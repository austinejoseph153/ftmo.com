It has boosted my confidence in my trading ability and shown me that I can achieve anything I set my mind to with discipline, hard work, and dedication. Knowing that I have a solid source of income has brought me a sense of security that I have never felt before in my career, and I am excited to see what the future holds for me as a professional trader. This is only the beginning, and I am ready to progress with a sense of fearlessness. If I can do it, so can you! Believe in yourself, stay disciplined, and the sky&#8217;s the limit!<\/p>\n<p><strong>What was the most difficult during your FTMO Challenge or Verification and how did you overcome it?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The FTMO Challenge and Verification was a challenging but rewarding experience for me as a trader. The most difficult part was to fully trust my trading plan and to stick to it, especially when market conditions were tough. However, I overcame this challenge by focusing on actioning my plan and evaluating myself based on how well I followed it, instead of just meeting the Trading Objectives. This experience taught me that success in trading is not just about hitting profit targets, but about having a disciplined and sustainable approach to trading. By remaining focused and disciplined, I was able to achieve my goals and become a more confident trader. If you&#8217;re going through the FTMO Challenge and Verification, remember that discipline and trusting your plan are the key to success. Trust your plan, stick to it, and evaluate yourself based on how well you follow it.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Do you plan to take another FTMO Challenge to manage an even bigger capital?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This is one of my long-term goals, but for now I want to gain more experience as a disciplined and sustainable funded trader before I progress onto another FTMO Challenge.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-547155\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Takudzwa-trades.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"906\" height=\"1289\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Takudzwa-trades.png 906w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Takudzwa-trades-211x300.png 211w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Takudzwa-trades-724x1030.png 724w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Takudzwa-trades-768x1093.png 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Takudzwa-trades-496x705.png 496w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Takudzwa-trades-17x24.png 17w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Takudzwa-trades-25x36.png 25w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Takudzwa-trades-34x48.png 34w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 906px) 100vw, 906px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>How did you manage your emotions when you were in a losing trade?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Managing emotions during losing trades was crucial for me to do well in the Challenge. To manage my emotions, I stayed away from impulsively checking my trades and reminded myself to trust the plan. I had predefined stop-loss levels that helped me limit losses and avoid taking on too much risk. By also accepting losses as an inevitable part of the journey, I could stay disciplined and trust the process even during a series of losing trades.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Describe your best trade.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>My best trade was on the USD\/JPY pair where I made a 2% return. This involved completing a thorough analysis, sticking to my plan, and executing my plan with full confidence. I was able to avoid emotional interference and to make irrational decisions. This helped me to maximize my profits and avoid the temptation to make impulsive decisions or exit the trade too early. This trade reinforced the importance of staying disciplined and focused on the plan and avoiding impulsive decisions or emotional trading.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What would you like to say to other traders that are attempting the FTMO Challenge?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>As a trader who recently passed the FTMO Challenge, my advice to other traders attempting the Challenge is to trust your plan, stick to it, and evaluate yourself based on how well you follow it. Don&#8217;t give up, as it may take time for everything to click. Also, try a few Free Trials first before attempting the Challenge. Keep a positive attitude and stay motivated, and you will succeed!<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/trader.ftmo.com\/start-challenge?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=banner&amp;utm_campaign=tradersqa\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-546397 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_2-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"130\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_2-1.png 800w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_2-1-300x49.png 300w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_2-1-768x125.png 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_2-1-705x115.png 705w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_2-1-24x4.png 24w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_2-1-36x6.png 36w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_2-1-48x8.png 48w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Trader Rugved: I am now at a stage where I can shut off my emotions by simply focusing on my plan.<\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-547112\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Rugved-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Rugved-300x300.jpg 300w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Rugved-1030x1030.jpg 1030w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Rugved-80x80.jpg 80w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Rugved-768x768.jpg 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Rugved-1536x1536.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Rugved-36x36.jpg 36w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Rugved-180x180.jpg 180w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Rugved-1500x1500.jpg 1500w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Rugved-705x705.jpg 705w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Rugved-24x24.jpg 24w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Rugved-48x48.jpg 48w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Rugved.jpg 1824w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Where have you learnt about FTMO?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>By word of mouth.

But over the last few months, I have learnt to put my emotions aside using 1 tactic. That is my focusing on my plan and focusing on my process. I used to be too focused on making money, this led to complacency with following my plan. Furthermore, this led to more losses. However, I am now at a stage where I can shut off my emotions by simply focusing on my plan. This has been very helpful to me. It has taken stress away as I am no longer thinking about making money.

However, the beauty is that if you can manage to cut out the noise, you can find a way to trade that is uniquely your own.

The Maximum Loss limits did not affect my trading style as much as I was only risking 0.5% &#8211; 1% of my account during the FTMO Challenge. In order to achieve long-term consistency, it is vital that good parameters and rules are set in place, so they can be followed. The Maximum Loss limits help to avoid revenge trading and over-trading on your account.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Do you have a trading plan in place, and do you follow it strictly?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>A trading plan is essential so yes, I do. I only take a maximum of 1-3 trades a day, the risk parameters can range from 0.5%-2% depending on the capital buffer present and the trade set-up. I only trade during the London or New York sessions.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What was the most difficult during your FTMO Challenge or Verification and how did you overcome it?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Patience was a factor that I found to be difficult as I took more trades than I expected in a day. Hence, whilst evaluating my statistics, I would like to patiently wait for setups to reach my price before I execute a trade, this will help improve my overall equity curve and thus my performance. In my Verification phase, my psychology lacked considerably, however, it just took 1-3 good trades to make up for all my losses. This is the power of risk management. I am consistently working on improving these issues so I can level up! Trading in the zone by Mark Douglas is a book that I actively read in order to combat these issues, I believe this book honestly is the holy grail to improving your psychology.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-547176\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Abbie-trades.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"905\" height=\"1290\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Abbie-trades.png 905w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Abbie-trades-210x300.png 210w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Abbie-trades-723x1030.png 723w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Abbie-trades-768x1095.png 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Abbie-trades-495x705.png 495w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Abbie-trades-17x24.png 17w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Abbie-trades-25x36.png 25w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Abbie-trades-34x48.png 34w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 905px) 100vw, 905px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Has your psychology ever affected your trading plan?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>During the FTMO Challenge, I would say dealing with psychology was a major part of my journey as learning to cope with wins and losses can be difficult. After a nice 1:3RRR trade, I could see through the Account MetriX, that my performance dipped due to overconfidence. In order to combat psychological struggles, I adjusted my rules, whereby I did not trade after a winning trade or I stopped trading after a losing trade.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How did you eliminate the factor of luck in your trading?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I can have a set of winning trades, day in and day out, which some may call lucky.
