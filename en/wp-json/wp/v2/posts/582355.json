Trader&#8217;s Analysis presents this long-term data in a clear format that offers you a valuable and comprehensive insight into your FTMO trading history.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>When developing or testing a trading strategy, good quality data and long-term history are critical for the result to have a meaningful value. The lower the quality of the data source and the smaller the data set, the less valuable the final result of the test or analysis. In real trading, such analysis can therefore do more harm than good.<\/p>\n<h2>Trader&#8217;s Analysis for all serious traders<\/h2>\n<p>We at FTMO are very aware of this and have worked on yet another of the many applications that should help our traders to achieve better long-term results. As the name implies, the Trader&#8217;s Analysis is a service designed to allow all of our traders to analyse all of the accounts that they have traded (or are trading) with FTMO. This way, each FTMO Trader will receive comprehensive statistics covering virtually all of the trades they have executed through FTMO, allowing them to thoroughly analyse their progress with FTMO.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/trader.ftmo.com\/start-challenge?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=banner&amp;utm_campaign=traders-analysis\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-546397 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_2-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"130\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_2-1.png 800w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_2-1-300x49.png 300w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_2-1-768x125.png 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_2-1-705x115.png 705w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_2-1-24x4.png 24w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_2-1-36x6.png 36w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_2-1-48x8.png 48w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>The application can be found in the left column of the Client Area, in the Applications section (bottom of the left column). You do not need to download or install anything to launch it, it is available in a similar way you access the MetriX Application. Just below the initial welcome, you can see the account numbers (for FTMO Accounts, Verifications, and FTMO Challenges) that the analysis will cover. By default, all accounts are selected for the analysis, however, you can change the selection in the option found below.<\/p>\n<h2>Set everything up your way<\/h2>\n<p>The above section is followed by the Settings box, where you can filter your selection according to predefined criteria. First, you can choose whether you want the chart to show your trading progress in monetary terms or as a percentage.<\/p>\n<p>In the next box, you can specify the period you want to monitor. This can be a period from a certain date to the end (in which case you have to double-click on the selected start date), or you can specify the start and end of the selected period (it doesn&#8217;t matter which date you enter first, the end or the start). To deselect, click on the arrow icon.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-582288\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/TA-Settings-M.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"905\" height=\"742\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/TA-Settings-M.png 2040w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/TA-Settings-M-300x246.png 300w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/TA-Settings-M-1030x844.png 1030w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/TA-Settings-M-768x629.png 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/TA-Settings-M-1536x1259.png 1536w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/TA-Settings-M-1500x1229.png 1500w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/TA-Settings-M-705x578.png 705w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 905px) 100vw, 905px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>You can then select the account types you want to analyse. The available account types include Verifications, only FTMO Accounts, etc., or you can simply monitor all accounts together (this is the default setting). Similarly, you can then select accounts based on whether they were successful, unsuccessful, or just the ones you are still trading on.<\/p>\n<h2>Customize your choice<\/h2>\n<p>At the bottom of the Settings section, you can enter account numbers that you would like to exclude from the analysis (exceptionally, you were unsuccessful or used other strategies and the results would be inconclusive, etc.).

This is quite important data (the exact number will show up when you hover over the bar), and you can see that when an instrument has a large percentage representation, and poor results, omitting it can improve long-term trading results (and sometimes quite substantially).<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-582312\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/TA-Statistics.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"903\" height=\"826\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/TA-Statistics.png 903w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/TA-Statistics-300x274.png 300w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/TA-Statistics-768x703.png 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/TA-Statistics-705x645.png 705w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 903px) 100vw, 903px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>As you can see from the above chart, 21.1% of all trades placed by the trader were for the EURUSD pair (green box), which was also his most profitable instrument, which is great. Things are a bit worse for the GBPJPY pair (blue box). 23.4% of all his trades were for this pair, however, it was his most losing instrument. Based on these results, this trader should consider limiting the number of trades he executes for this instrument.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/en\/scaling-plan\/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=banner&amp;utm_campaign=traders-analysis\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-546367 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_3-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"130\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_3-1.png 800w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_3-1-300x49.png 300w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_3-1-768x125.png 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_3-1-705x115.png 705w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_3-1-24x4.png 24w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_3-1-36x6.png 36w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_3-1-48x8.png 48w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Being more active does not necessarily mean being more profitable<\/h2>\n<p>The next two charts show the results and trader\u2019s activity (number of trades) made in each month. As you can see, the worst month in terms of profit (02.2022) was also one of the months when the trader was most active. On the other hand, when his activity reduced in late 2022 and early 2023, it led to his best results. This may not be correlated and may not be a clear rule. However, these are the types of patterns of behaviour that can lead to improved long-term results, after the trader reviews his long-term analysis and adjusts his trading style accordingly.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-582320\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/TA-Result-Activity.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"904\" height=\"788\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/TA-Result-Activity.png 904w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/TA-Result-Activity-300x262.png 300w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/TA-Result-Activity-768x669.png 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/TA-Result-Activity-705x615.png 705w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 904px) 100vw, 904px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The next chart shows the average trade duration in a given month, which, of course, will be reflected in the previous activity chart (fewer trades taking longer and vice versa), but may also be reflected in the results.
