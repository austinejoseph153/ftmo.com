I have three setups. The first is trend continuation off trend line. The second is break and re-test of structure. The third is trend continuation using structure and Fibonacci replacement. Over the last few months, I have implemented a strict risk management plan, so I am able to control my emotions and manage my account. I used to not follow my plan but after enough losses I began to strictly follow my system because I understand the consequences.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What was the hardest obstacle on your trading journey?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The hardest obstacle of my trading journey was patience. I wanted to make money in the market everyday and ignored the fact that I need to wait for the market to set up. I would trade at the worst times and by the time the move I was waiting for comes, I already lost too much money and cant take advantage of the move. Once I began to stay patient and only trade when my setup comes around, I was able to be to make more profit, limit my losses, limit my emotions, and reduce my stress while trading.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How did you eliminate the factor of luck in your trading?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I use confluence to eliminate the factor of luck in my trading. I have specific setups that I look for and when I have confluence with multiple signals telling me to enter a trade I understand why I am entering and what I am risking. I give my trade room to breath and only trade if my pre-trade checklist is complete.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/alm.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-394770\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/alm.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1155\" height=\"890\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/alm.png 1155w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/alm-300x231.png 300w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/alm-1030x794.png 1030w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/alm-768x592.png 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/alm-705x543.png 705w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1155px) 100vw, 1155px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>What was easier than expected during the FTMO Challenge or Verification?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The Verification was easier than the Challenge because the profit target was smaller but I understood that I needed to view both tasks as equal. The reason is If I had traded the Verification task with the mindset that it was easy and didn&#8217;t deserve effort, I would have been more prone to trade reckless and abort my trading plan.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How would you rate your experience with FTMO?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The FTMO experience was beyond amazing. The Challenge increased my trading self-esteem and improved my risk management. Trading an account size this big showed me that 1% is more than enough risk to make a good amount of money and that I can remove a huge aspect of emotion in my trading.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What would you like to say to other traders that are attempting the FTMO Challenge?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I would tell other traders to be patient. Everyone wants to finish the Challenge in the shortest amount of time but there&#8217;s no rule that states that. Don&#8217;t trade multiple times a day and increase lot size just to finish fast. I was down 4% on my account before I completed the Challenge. Trade your best setups, believe in yourself, and be patient.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>What makes trader Kevin pursue trading?<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/kevinp.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-394741\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/kevinp-221x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"221\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/kevinp-221x300.jpg 221w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/kevinp-757x1030.jpg 757w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/kevinp-768x1044.jpg 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/kevinp-1129x1536.jpg 1129w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/kevinp-1103x1500.jpg 1103w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/kevinp-518x705.jpg 518w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/kevinp.jpg 1242w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 221px) 100vw, 221px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>Do you plan to take another FTMO Challenge to manage even bigger capital?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Of course!, This the 100k account is just one step of the journey.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How does passing the FTMO Challenge and Verification changed your life?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It gives me a sense that all the hard work that I have been putting in is finally beginning to pay off.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What inspires you to pursue trading?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I want a better life for me and my family, this is bigger than me.
