I know each trade is an independent decision of its own and as I continue to learn from every trade I place, I also know that the next trade can just as easily be in profit as a bad trade can be in loss. It\u2019s Okay, that\u2019s why we have risk management.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Has your psychology ever affected your trading plan?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I know we all go through a learning curve of experiences when becoming a professional trader. However, being disciplined with self-control and having a specific set of rules for a winning strategy have to be 100% in place with some breathing room for margin of error. This helps me keep the psychology of emotion from being a part of my calculated decision and risk for each trade.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How has passing the FTMO Challenge and Verification changed your life?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Hey, whoever\u2019s reading this &#8211; it\u2019s a \u201cChange\u201d of your life.

It was trading as usual to patiently wait for the right set-up and execute my trading plan accordingly.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Do you have a trading plan in place, and do you follow it strictly?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Yes, I do. I don\u2019t believe there\u2019s any other way to trade consistently and successfully. Trading without a plan is like throwing darts blindfolded and expecting to hit your target, sounds ridiculous and it\u2019s just not going to happen.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What is the number one advice you would give to a new trader?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Trade very very small amounts. It has nothing to do with the size of the trade \u2013 it\u2019s the percentage of your loss\/gain. Master this with a solid trading strategy, risk management and self-discipline to practice, practice, practice, be patient and wait for the market to come to you. You have to move with the Volume Wave Flow of Momentum to be successful and without learning these 3 core disciplines, trading successfully as a profession will never be achievable from my point of view. So, good luck out there because the market doesn\u2019t care about your account and will take the most amount of money from the most amount of people unless you figure out why you have an edge to keep that from happening.<\/p>\n<h3>Trader Maximo: &#8220;Keep grinding, the world doesn&#8217;t stop for anyone.&#8221;<\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-541216\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/Maximo-139x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"139\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/Maximo-139x300.jpg 139w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/Maximo-476x1030.jpg 476w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/Maximo-768x1662.jpg 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/Maximo-710x1536.jpg 710w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/Maximo-693x1500.jpg 693w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/Maximo-326x705.jpg 326w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/Maximo-11x24.jpg 11w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/Maximo-17x36.jpg 17w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/Maximo-22x48.jpg 22w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/Maximo.jpg 828w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 139px) 100vw, 139px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>What do you think is the most important characteristic\/attribute to become a profitable trader?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I think the most important characteristic\/attribute is being patient.

Obviously, reaching the 10K target was something that wasn\u2019t easy as you only have 30 days to achieve. Markets can sometimes be extremely unpredictable hence you tend to overtrade, and it becomes slightly harder when you are in a loss as the target of 10k then becomes bigger with you trying to recover the losses first.
