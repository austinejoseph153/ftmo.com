What drew me to trading was the idea of being able to work on my own terms, freedom of time and space. I quickly fell in love with the markets. However, I always knew it was not as easy as some people make it out to be and it would take a serious amount of time and dedication. I always felt I could become the best at anything I felt passionate about and this was no exception.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What was easier than expected during the FTMO Challenge or Verification?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Reaching the target long before the deadline. Timing is everything.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What was the hardest obstacle on your trading journey?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Overtrading. It took me a few challenges, and even a blown funded account to learn the hard way. Lowering my risk and setting clear rules, such as stopping trading after 2 losses in a day, helped me.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-542454\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Rishaad-trades.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"910\" height=\"1219\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Rishaad-trades.png 910w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Rishaad-trades-224x300.png 224w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Rishaad-trades-769x1030.png 769w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Rishaad-trades-768x1029.png 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Rishaad-trades-526x705.png 526w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Rishaad-trades-18x24.png 18w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Rishaad-trades-27x36.png 27w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Rishaad-trades-36x48.png 36w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 910px) 100vw, 910px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>What do you think is the key for long-term success in trading?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think everyone will have a different answer depending on their personality. For me, it\u2019s having a long-term approach and goals, it allows me to not over-risk or get attached to like one trade. Also, having healthy living habits in general. I start my morning away from the charts, it helps to get my mindset clear and get me in my zone. I always start my mornings stretching and working out, then I have breakfast, after that I will look at the charts.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>How did you manage your emotions when you were in a losing trade?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I journal every trade that I take, I feel it\u2019s very important at the end of the day to analyze your trades. I also back test the week that passed and review the trades that I\u2019ve taken. Doing this allows me to gather enough data to not let losing trades affect me negatively. I don\u2019t trade during the night for the benefit of getting good sleep and also because of the widening spreads during early hours of the morning. Again, just healthy living habits in general.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>What would you like to say to other traders that are attempting the FTMO Challenge?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take it 1 step at a time. Don\u2019t get attached to the charts or the monetary value. Focus more on the process and on enjoying it, being in a positive mood. You will go through many ups and downs, if you persist you will be successful.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Trader Sherelle: &#8220;As new traders, we tend to place more value in a miracle strategy or indicator.&#8221;<\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-542462 size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Sherelle-199x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"199\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Sherelle-199x300.jpg 199w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Sherelle-684x1030.jpg 684w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Sherelle-768x1156.jpg 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Sherelle-1020x1536.jpg 1020w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Sherelle-1360x2048.jpg 1360w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Sherelle-996x1500.jpg 996w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Sherelle-468x705.jpg 468w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Sherelle-16x24.jpg 16w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Sherelle-24x36.jpg 24w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Sherelle-32x48.jpg 32w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Sherelle-scaled.jpg 1700w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 199px) 100vw, 199px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Do you plan to take another FTMO Challenge to manage an even bigger capital?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Yes, of course.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What do you think is the most important characteristic\/attribute to become a profitable trader?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>For me, it&#8217;s someone who is able to stay calm under pressure or practice excellent trading psychology. Unfortunately, it is something that is often overlooked. As new traders, we tend to place more value in that miracle strategy or indicator but throughout my journey, it was only when I learned to manage my emotions, be disciplined, and maintain a calm and objective mindset in the market that I was able to become profitable.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Describe your best trade.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I honestly can&#8217;t remember the specific trade, but it was the first trade that I placed using my new strategy. Even though the trade itself or resulting profit wasn&#8217;t that noteworthy (especially since it was on a demo account), I still think of it as the best because it was the first trade I placed using a strategy that specifically was for me. Before I had wasted so much time on strategies that worked only for others, but with this one, I had finally created a strategy that best suited &#8211; my personality, my strengths, my weaknesses; that best suited me.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-542469\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Sharelle-trades.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"907\" height=\"1219\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Sharelle-trades.png 907w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Sharelle-trades-223x300.png 223w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Sharelle-trades-766x1030.png 766w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Sharelle-trades-768x1032.png 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Sharelle-trades-525x705.png 525w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Sharelle-trades-18x24.png 18w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Sharelle-trades-27x36.png 27w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Sharelle-trades-36x48.png 36w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 907px) 100vw, 907px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>How did you manage your emotions when you were in a losing trade?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I simply walk away and recite some mantras like &#8220;there will always be another trade&#8221; or &#8220;I picked a high-probability setup and managed it to the best of my ability, so I did my job and did it well.&#8221; The market can sometimes rattle us and cause us to forget those truths so in moments like those I recite them to ground myself.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Has your psychology ever affected your trading plan?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>They work hand in hand.

Keeping a clear and calm mind is essential. Do whatever works for you &#8211; meditation, yoga, listen to music or podcasts, exercise etc. In the midst of the evaluation, try to maintain good trading psychology and if you feel it is beginning to suffer, take a break and step away from the markets.<\/p>\n<h3>Trader Victor Patrick: &#8220;It&#8217;s important to know when to take a step back and to stop trading.&#8221;<\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-542476\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Victor-Patrick-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Victor-Patrick-300x300.jpg 300w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Victor-Patrick-1030x1030.jpg 1030w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Victor-Patrick-80x80.jpg 80w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Victor-Patrick-768x768.jpg 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Victor-Patrick-1536x1536.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Victor-Patrick-36x36.jpg 36w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Victor-Patrick-180x180.jpg 180w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Victor-Patrick-1500x1500.jpg 1500w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Victor-Patrick-705x705.jpg 705w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Victor-Patrick-24x24.jpg 24w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Victor-Patrick-48x48.jpg 48w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Victor-Patrick.jpg 1822w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>How did you manage your emotions when you were in a losing trade?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s important to know when to take a step back and to stop trading. I also keep on reminding myself that it&#8217;s better to lose a small amount rather than a larger amount through emotional trading, and that a smaller loss can easily be repaired rather than a bigger loss.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Has your psychology ever affected your trading plan?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>My biggest psychological barrier to trading is when being in a losing trade, to keep on over trading even if there aren&#8217;t clear signs from my trading plan in just hopes of covering up the losses.
