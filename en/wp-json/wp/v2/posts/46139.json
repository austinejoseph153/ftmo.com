These instruments are part of the offerings with most reputable brokers worldwide. However, unlike Futures indexes, these instruments are not standardized as brokers allow us to trade them through <strong>CFD<\/strong>s.<\/p>\n<p><strong>CFD<\/strong> (Contract for Difference) is an agreement between the buyer and the seller, which obliges the seller to pay the beneficiary (buyer) a difference between the current value of the asset and the value of the asset at a time of contract closure. If the difference in price is negative, then the buyer pays the seller. <strong>CFD<\/strong>s are financial derivatives that allow us to speculate on the price development of the underlying asset, without the need to own the underlying asset. The underlying asset can be a stock index, commodity, equity or currency.<\/p>\n<p>Our <a href=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/en\/\">funded challenge FTMO Accounts allow trading<\/a> CFD-based instruments with liquidity being delivered by multiple providers.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s say that we want to trade the very popular German DAX on Futures markets. Due to the large volatility, the intra-day margin is around 11,000 \u20ac per contract. The intra-day margin is the reserve deposit on the account for opening the trade. If we were to hold the position overnight, then the margin reaches far beyond 21,000 \u20ac.<\/p>\n<p>How about commissions? Well, the commissions for trading <strong>CFD<\/strong>s are generally far greater than on Futures. However, the truth is that trading Futures is still much more difficult financially, also for the reason of paying for the data feed and platforms. If we focus solely on trading commissions, then trading Futures is cheaper. All-inclusive round-turn commission for DAX (buy and sell) cost 6-7 \u20ac on average. The commission for one standard lot traded on DAX through <strong>CFD<\/strong> is approximately 20 \u20ac.<\/p>\n<p>It is important to take into account that the majority of retail traders don\u2019t have 21,000 \u20ac to spare for trading DAX from the beginning. This is where the best advantage of <strong>CFD<\/strong> comes in place as opposed to the Futures. Dividing the positions enable us to trade DAX with much smaller capital requirements. From the risk-taking perspective, having the possibility to trade DAX through <strong>CFD<\/strong> is yet more significant. From the commission comparison perspective, it is apparent that experienced traders managing multi-contracts rather trade DAX on the market as the difference in the commissions is notable.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/futures_vs_cfds.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-46153\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/futures_vs_cfds-1030x470.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1030\" height=\"470\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/futures_vs_cfds-1030x470.png 1030w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/futures_vs_cfds-300x137.png 300w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/futures_vs_cfds-768x350.png 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/futures_vs_cfds-705x322.png 705w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/futures_vs_cfds-450x205.png 450w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/futures_vs_cfds.png 1061w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1030px) 100vw, 1030px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Comparison of the capital requirements of the futures contract and the CFD on the DAX market<\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-81118\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/cfd_table_2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1014\" height=\"505\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/cfd_table_2.png 1014w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/cfd_table_2-300x149.png 300w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/cfd_table_2-768x382.png 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/cfd_table_2-705x351.png 705w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/cfd_table_2-450x224.png 450w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1014px) 100vw, 1014px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>In the last column of the above table, we can see the DAX position sized 0.2 lots traded through <strong>CFD<\/strong>. The beauty of <strong>CFD<\/strong>s is in the possibility of working with multi-contracts while having a small capital. If we were to trade the highest position of 0.2 lots while having two different profit targets, <strong>CFD<\/strong> allows us to enter twice by 0.1 lots each and set the required parameters separately.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, it\u2019s important to mention that trading the futures indexes through <strong>CFD<\/strong>s isn\u2019t suitable for all markets and this is due to the associated costs. This is predominantly for short-term traders who target smaller profits. Talking about the DAX index, the ratio between spread and the daily range is actually very good. The average daily range of DAX for the past 100 days is 224 points and the spread is 2 points. This makes DAX an ideal market to be traded through the <strong>CFD<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In this article, we will introduce the pros &amp; cons of trading on the CFDs (Contract for Difference) and will illustrate the entire concept on the arithmetical and graphical example.
