I found that sometimes I had trouble closing a trade early or making the call to exit a trade before it has reached take profit or stop loss levels. In order to solve this I came up with set of rules\/criteria to follow when it\u2019s nessacary to close a trade early.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What was more difficult than expected during your FTMO Challenge or Verification?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Sometimes when trading the 4hr timeframe my trades would take a couple of days before hitting stop loss or take profit. I find these require more patience. Also I have had trades get stopped out during the market session change over if the spread gets too large. I try not to hold 1HR timeframe trades over these periods.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What do you think is the most important characteristic\/attribute to become a profitable trader?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I think it would be to have strong patience and not never give up. It seems to journey to become a consistent trader is not easy and cant be rushed. Long term experience and practice plays a big role to success<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><a class=\"lightbox-added aligncenter\" href=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/BradyM.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-402654\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/BradyM.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 857px) 100vw, 857px\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/BradyM.png 857w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/BradyM-300x277.png 300w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/BradyM-768x709.png 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/BradyM-705x651.png 705w\" alt=\"\" width=\"857\" height=\"791\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>How did you eliminate the factor of luck in your trading?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I eliminate luck in my trading by using a series of trading indicators to filter out higher probability trading signals. I also pre-define my stop loss and take profits using the specific settings of ATR. I set up all my trades with a 1 to 1.5 risk-reward ratio, with the option to close trades above 1% gain early if the trade meets certain criteria. I have 3 trades open at one time only risking 1.55% per trade. This way I can utilize the majority of coming in under 5% risk of capital at one time<\/p>\n<p><strong>How would you rate your experience with FTMO?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>FTMO has been great so far. The website and performance data is easy to read and understand.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What would you like to say to other traders that are attempting the Challenge?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>One thing I would say is don\u2019t take the challenge until you are absolutely sure you are ready. I seem to have failed the challenge quite a few of times before I was able to pass it. Every time I thought I was ready, I was shown otherwise by the challenge results. I would recommend you thoroughly back-test and forward test your trading and have a solid trading plan before purchasing a challenge. If you fail the challenge do not give up. A failed challenge is an opportunity to learn from. Best to practice lots on a demo account as well.<\/p>\n<h3>Trader Afloeg \u2013\u00a0<em>\u201cBe patient and stick to your strategy without faltering.\u201d<\/em><\/h3>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><a class=\"lightbox-added aligncenter\" href=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/afloegp-scaled.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-402659\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/afloegp-300x225.jpeg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/afloegp-300x225.jpeg 300w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/afloegp-1030x773.jpeg 1030w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/afloegp-768x576.jpeg 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/afloegp-1536x1152.jpeg 1536w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/afloegp-2048x1536.jpeg 2048w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/afloegp-1500x1125.jpeg 1500w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/afloegp-705x529.jpeg 705w\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>What inspires you to pursue trading?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I have always believed that I was capable of achieving more in my life and knowing how difficult it is to become a profitable trader.

All skills must be acquired to achieve lasting success with the top 3 being technical, mental, and emotional. So you can see the majority of trading success is dependent on psychological factors and this is largely due to trading requiring counter-intuitive thinking which does not come naturally to most humans. It really does need to learn and honed over time.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What was the most difficult during your FTMO Challenge or Verification and how did you overcome it?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Timing a winning streak to fall within the 30-day window requirement was the most difficult and frustrating. Trading profits do not come in like a pay check at a day job, they come in runs of wins and losses so it may take you a few tries of the challenge to get this timing of the market returns in the right 30 day time window.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How did you eliminate the factor of luck in your trading?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Have a standard operating procedure (SOP) like any business is parament, even more so for a trading business.
