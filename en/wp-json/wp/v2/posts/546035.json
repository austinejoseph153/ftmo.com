By expanding your own awareness of self and reality and changing your perception of yourself and life itself your perception of trading will change which will help you see the charts and risk in a whole different light, so to speak, and this is within the &#8216;psychological&#8217; aspect of trading. Talking strategy, all you NEED to know is how to lose efficiently: to lose small and well. Once you learn how to do this with your strategy you will earn the money you desire.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/trader.ftmo.com\/start-challenge?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=banner&amp;utm_campaign=tradersqa\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-543692 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Blog-banner-Challenge-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"130\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Blog-banner-Challenge-1.jpg 800w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Blog-banner-Challenge-1-300x49.jpg 300w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Blog-banner-Challenge-1-768x125.jpg 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Blog-banner-Challenge-1-705x115.jpg 705w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Blog-banner-Challenge-1-24x4.jpg 24w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Blog-banner-Challenge-1-36x6.jpg 36w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Blog-banner-Challenge-1-48x8.jpg 48w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Trader Trevor: &#8220;Know your strategy and have tried it on a demo account at least once.&#8221;<\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-546024\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Trevor-200x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"200\" height=\"300\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>What does your risk management plan look like?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>My risk management plan is very simple, I use a Forex calculator to risk 1% of my account so that I may gain 3%.

I do not use any indicators in my trading like MACD or RSI because I do think that they do not work and show only the things that happened. The main thing I use is volumes taking the paid data directly from CME and also option zones, with the help of this instruments I am trying to identify the behaviour of big players in the market (as I do think that only big players are able to move the markets the way they want) and follow them, that is my key to future success.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What was the most difficult during your FTMO Challenge or Verification and how did you overcome it?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I do not think that there were some difficulties as I am taking this process not for the first time, the main thing in trading is to strictly follow your strategy at any conditions so this would be my little advice to everyone who will be passing the FTMO Challenge.<\/p>\n<p><strong>One piece of advice for people starting the FTMO Challenge now.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Strongly believe that FTMO is a fair company. As everyone, before taking the first Challenge, I also had many doubts if FTMO really give payouts and if your company does not do everything for people to fail. After the 5th month with you I could say that yes, FTMO pays all the pay-outs strictly day in day as written and, in terms of support and trading conditions, it is also great so my advice would be just to trust the process!<\/p>\n<h3>Trader Stward: &#8220;Those who seek success in this business must understand that the ability to control oneself is a real skill set.&#8221;<\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-546038\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Stward-225x300.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>What does your risk management plan look like?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Simple. I shouldn\u2019t have to take a hard guess on what lots or positions I should take if the chart makes no sense. I don\u2019t trade it. I once heard that the most effective way to win in casinos is to walk out as soon as you walk in. Trust me, it\u2019s true.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What do you think is the most important characteristic\/attribute to become a profitable trader?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Patience. Not just with the chart, but with yourself. Being a trader is not easy because it\u2019s a you vs. your game, those who seek success in this business must understand that the ability to control oneself is a real skill set. It\u2019ll get you paid.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How did you eliminate the factor of luck in your trading?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I didn\u2019t. I just know how to guide and control my luck, staying away from risky positions. In the book \u201cThe Psychology of Money\u201d it\u2019s explained how every scenario in your life is outputted by luck or risk, those who succeed most often are controlling that luck and staying away from risky business. I\u2019ve learned to do the same thing.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-546074\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Stward-trades.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"911\" height=\"1214\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Has your psychology ever affected your trading plan?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Yes, as a young trader I\u2019ve had many moments where the chart would speak to me and make me think irrationally. Once I realized that psychology was 75% of the work, I never looked back since.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What do you think is the key for long term success in trading?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Having a strong why. Having a trajectory for yourself. You\u2019ve got to know where you\u2019re heading, and why you\u2019re heading there. That\u2019s extremely important. Those who can\u2019t see themselves past the fancy cars and huge bank accounts have a very tough time seeing results in this business.<\/p>\n<p><strong>One piece of advice for people starting the FTMO Challenge now.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Take your time.
