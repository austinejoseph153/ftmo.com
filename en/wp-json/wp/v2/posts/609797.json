I have created a clear trading plan that includes risk management and tracking my progress. By being disciplined and patient, and testing different strategies, I make decisions based on data rather than luck. This helps me to <a href=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/en\/consistency-is-very-important-for-success-in-trading\/\">consistently perform<\/a> well over time.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How did loss limits affect your trading style?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Implementing maximum loss limits has impacted my trading style, leading me towards a more disciplined and risk-aware approach. I&#8217;ve learned to prioritize trade quality over quantity. This limitation has compelled me to enhance my analysis and selectivity, ensuring that each trade aligns with my trading plan and has a favorable reward to risk ratio. Consequently, this strategy has not only protected my capital from significant drawdowns but has also fostered a more methodical and less emotionally driven trading practice.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What was easier than expected during the FTMO Challenge or Verification?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I found the initial Challenge stage of the FTMO process to be easier than I expected, especially in terms of the psychological aspects. Although I was anxious about the high stakes, my focus on building a strong mental framework and trading discipline paid off. I was able to manage my fear and greed, stay focused, and stick to my trading plan with ease. This allowed me to make well-considered decisions that were crucial for passing the Challenge stage.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-610182 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/Denys-Trades.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"908\" height=\"1229\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/Denys-Trades.png 908w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/Denys-Trades-222x300.png 222w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/Denys-Trades-761x1030.png 761w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/Denys-Trades-768x1040.png 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/Denys-Trades-521x705.png 521w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 908px) 100vw, 908px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Do you have a trading plan in place, and do you follow it strictly?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Having a trading plan is essential to my approach, and I stick to it with strong discipline. My strategy prioritizes managing risk by allocating only 0.5 to 1% of my capital per trade. This way, I minimize exposure and protect my portfolio. My trading decisions are based on objective criteria, which eliminates emotions from the process. Each trade is executed with predetermined Take Profit (TP) and Stop Loss (SL) levels to ensure that potential gains are captured, and losses are contained. I seldom adjust the SL once it&#8217;s set, as I believe in maintaining my initial risk assessment and avoiding emotional responses to market fluctuations. This disciplined approach not only helps manage risk but also fosters consistency and predictability in my trading outcomes.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Do you plan to take another FTMO Challenge to manage even bigger capital?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I aim to complete a $200k challenge and merge it into a $400k account. Eventually, I would like to receive the maximum allocation possible.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/trader.ftmo.com\/start-challenge?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=banner&amp;utm_campaign=tradersqa\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-608275 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/Get-100-000-banner-EN.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"950\" height=\"130\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/Get-100-000-banner-EN.jpg 950w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/Get-100-000-banner-EN-300x41.jpg 300w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/Get-100-000-banner-EN-768x105.jpg 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/Get-100-000-banner-EN-705x96.jpg 705w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 950px) 100vw, 950px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>What is the number one piece of advice you would give to a new trader?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Start with a solid educational foundation and always adhere to strict risk management rules.<\/p>\n<h3>Trader Jorge Miguel: \u201cTrading must be approached in a cold, rigid and very calculated way.\u201d<\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-609806\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/Jorge-Miguel-300x225.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/Jorge-Miguel-300x225.jpeg 300w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/Jorge-Miguel-1030x773.jpeg 1030w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/Jorge-Miguel-768x576.jpeg 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/Jorge-Miguel-1536x1152.jpeg 1536w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/Jorge-Miguel-2048x1536.jpeg 2048w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/Jorge-Miguel-1500x1125.jpeg 1500w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/Jorge-Miguel-705x529.jpeg 705w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Where have you learnt about FTMO?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It was in 2019 that I decided to learn more about this industry and chose to look for more people with the same ambition and even the possibility of having a mentor, someone with whom I could exchange ideas, clarify doubts, and learn together.

One step at a time, but always with the aim of improving and growing more and more financially.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What is the number one advice you would give to a new trader?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The number one piece of advice is to create a trading plan and adjust it whenever necessary.

I entered the trade at an opportune moment, just as the stock broke out of a key resistance level with strong momentum. Throughout the trade, I diligently monitored the price action and market conditions, <a href=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/en\/how-can-you-improve-your-stop-loss-and-take-profit\/\">adjusting my Stop Loss and Take Profit<\/a> levels accordingly to manage risk and capture profits.
