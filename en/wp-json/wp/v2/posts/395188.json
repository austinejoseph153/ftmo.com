A few years ago, I watched tons of videos on business and how other people had made it.<\/p>\n<p>One video talked about scalability of a business and mentioned trading as an example. That idea stuck with me and I started doing it ever since.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How did you manage your emotions when you were in a losing trade?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>As long as that losing trade fits my trading plan, I do not feel emotionally bad anymore.<\/p>\n<p>If I risk too much or entered too late and it derived from my trading plan, I try to not trade for a few days, as some sort of punishment and condition myself to not do it again.<\/p>\n<p>Also journaling helps a lot and I go through my journal on the weekends and review what I did well and not so well that week.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/leim.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-395192\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/leim.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"911\" height=\"850\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/leim.jpg 911w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/leim-300x280.jpg 300w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/leim-768x717.jpg 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/leim-705x658.jpg 705w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 911px) 100vw, 911px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>What was easier than expected during the FTMO Challenge or Verification?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>10% capital gain at challenge phase may seem to be a lot for most traders but I do not agree with that statement saying FTMO makes the challenge too difficult. Let me explain why.<\/p>\n<p>In math, especially in probability calculation there is a term called variance.<\/p>\n<p>This term describes the deviation of the expected value. Without getting into the specifics, that means: The lower the win rate, the higher the variances.<\/p>\n<p>The higher the no. of trades I take, the closer it gets to the expected value.<\/p>\n<p>From my own back testing my strategy had a win rate of about 60-65% (it is higher in the account metrics due to closing trades partially and filling days with mini lots), so my variance is not that high, which makes a losing streak unlikely.<\/p>\n<p>But even if it worked against me, I should passed the challenge more often. In the verification the variance actually worked for me, so I passed it pretty fast.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What is the number one advice you would give to a new trader?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Practice, practice, practice. It is like learning any skill, if you do not do it yourself, you will never learn it. The learning curve is not linear but rises exponentially. Just don&#8217;t give up.<\/p>\n<h3>What was the best trade for trader Sami?<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/samip.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-395195\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/samip-196x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"196\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/samip-196x300.jpg 196w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/samip-461x705.jpg 461w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/samip.jpg 568w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 196px) 100vw, 196px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>What was easier than expected during the FTMOChallenge or Verification?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Risk management became more apparent to follow to succeed.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Where have you learned about FTMO?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Through a referral who was already successful in becoming a trader for FTMO.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Describe your best trade.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Momentum-based trade on GJ, where I entered the market at a cheaper price before it made a big percentage of change in price in such a short amount of time.

I stick to my trading rules and maintain discipline strictly.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How does passing the Challenge and Verification changed your life?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Passing the Challenge and Verification has instilled more confidence in me, as a person and as well as a trader.

I trade only when my trading plan\/ strategy is applicable in the market and do not force it in all market conditions, which is impractical.<\/p>\n<p>I do not give into emotions like fear of losing, fear of missing out or greed.<\/p>\n<p>I treat good and bad days equal. I do not let it get to my head. So, the answer is NO, my psychology has not affected my trading plan almost 90% of the time.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What would you like to say to other traders that are attempting the FTMO Challenge?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Firstly, approach the challenge with confidence. Never be overconfident or emotional. Work at the moment!<\/p>\n<p>The main focus here is the daily loss limit. I would never let my daily losses go beyond $200 on average.<\/p>\n<p>Accept a loss that you\u2019re only capable of recovering the next day. If your trades aren\u2019t going well as planned, PAUSE!<\/p>\n<p>Do not do revenge trading just to recover those losses. You can always start fresh the next day.<\/p>\n<p>Try to be consistent and make maximum profits when it\u2019s a good day in the market.<\/p>\n<p>Do not over trade! Make about minimum 10%-15% of the target every day and you\u2019re good to go. Discipline, Consistency and Risk Management is everything in FTMO, irrespective of any trading plan you follow.<\/p>\n<p>Lastly, believe in yourself that you can do it! Don\u2019t let the losses make you feel like a loser.<\/p>\n<p>You are much more than that and you got much more than what you see on the trades. Keep that fire burning and never stop believing in yourself. You will definitely pass the Challenge. Good luck and God bless.<\/p>\n<h3>Trader Kok<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/1600417919_IMG3548-scaled.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-395221\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/1600417919_IMG3548-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/1600417919_IMG3548-225x300.jpg 225w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/1600417919_IMG3548-773x1030.jpg 773w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/1600417919_IMG3548-768x1024.jpg 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/1600417919_IMG3548-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/1600417919_IMG3548-1536x2048.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/1600417919_IMG3548-1125x1500.jpg 1125w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/1600417919_IMG3548-529x705.jpg 529w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/1600417919_IMG3548-scaled.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>What do you think is the key for long-term success in trading?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>There are three things every successful trader must have. 1. A profitable consistent trading plan. 2. A success goal for yourself as a trader. 3. Strong discipline and consistency. When you possess the above three criteria, the question is not how you succeed anymore, it is when.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How does your risk management plan look like?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Risk management is the key to trading. I would not risk more than 1% of the risk on every trade that I enter.<\/p>\n<p>Simultaneously, I would not expose myself to the same currency pair for more than 2% of the risk. With this trading plan, I am able to pass the challenge with ease.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What inspires you to pursue trading?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>My passion. I am very passionate about trading and looking at graphs and numbers. The objective that inspires me to pursue trading is financial independence.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Describe your best trade.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I would say my best trade would be GBP\/USD in my Stage 2 &#8211; Verification Stage.<\/p>\n<p>I had my trading plan ready to short GBP\/USD. It fit all my criteria to enter but unfortunately, I got stopped out at the first time.<\/p>\n<p>When the price came back to my stop out level, I still saw the pair meeting my criteria, so I shorted GBP\/USD again. With strong discipline and 2 scaling in position, I managed to pass my Stage 2 using just GBP\/USD.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/kokm.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-395227\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/kokm.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"932\" height=\"866\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/kokm.jpg 932w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/kokm-300x279.jpg 300w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/kokm-768x714.jpg 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/kokm-705x655.jpg 705w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 932px) 100vw, 932px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>Do you have a trading plan in place, and do you follow it strictly?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Definitely.

Hence, I follow strictly to my plan.<\/p>\n<p>For taking losses, I had a risk management plan as mentioned before. For every position I take, it will have to fit all my trading criteria.<\/p>\n<p>First, the price must be within my area of interest, normally key resistance\/support zone at higher time frame, normally H4 or Daily. Second, there must be a price action for me to confirm my entry, for e.g. a shooting star, Fibonacci Retracement Level, or rejections at key areas.<\/p>\n<p>Third, follow your plan strictly.
