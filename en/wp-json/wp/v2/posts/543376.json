There are hundreds of moments where you believe you\u2019ve mastered the game, only to be humbled by a string of losses. The truth is, there is no magic formula, just your edge and playing the probabilities.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Has your psychology ever affected your trading plan?<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>The funding challenges always test your psychology, the closer you get to your profit target, the tendency to make irrational and impulsive mistakes increases. My trading plan always becomes inconsistent when I\u2019m near the target.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>How did you manage your emotions when you were in a losing trade?<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No one likes drawdown, ultimately the only certain thing about the market is uncertainty. You can\u2019t take losses and drawdowns personally. Adopting a probability mindset is a major way to desensitize yourself from negative emotions. I personally meditate before I trade the London session. I will literally visualize myself being in drawdown and losing trades so I can prepare for it in advance.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-543423 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/David-trades.png\" alt=\"Trader David's Account MetriX Verification 1300368077\" width=\"905\" height=\"1211\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/David-trades.png 905w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/David-trades-224x300.png 224w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/David-trades-770x1030.png 770w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/David-trades-768x1028.png 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/David-trades-527x705.png 527w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/David-trades-18x24.png 18w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/David-trades-27x36.png 27w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/David-trades-36x48.png 36w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 905px) 100vw, 905px\" \/><\/p>\n<h4><strong>Do you plan to take another FTMO Challenge to manage even more capital?<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Trading is a marathon, and not a sprint. Early in my trading career I took on FTMO Challenges that I wasn\u2019t mentally equipped to deal with<strong><em>. <\/em><\/strong>Progression of capital should be a slow process. I would love to manage larger capital, but based on lessons from my past, avoiding greed will be paramount.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>What was the most difficult during your FTMO Challenge or Verification and how did you overcome it?<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During Verification my equity exceeded the 5% profit target for a brief second, however, the take profit didn\u2019t trigger and was 1 pip away. Price then aggressively reversed in the other direction, and I ended up closing the trade. A bad string of trades followed, and my emotions were all over the place. I quite literally had to take some days off to regain my sense of composure and clear my mind.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><strong>What would you like to say to other traders that are attempting the FTMO Challenge?<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don\u2019t let fear become your enemy, losing trades are inevitable and will happen in flurries. I still struggle with it now, but let your winners run, or add size to winning trades. Taking a quick profit will sometimes help you in the short term, but over the long run you\u2019ll probably be compromising your profitability. If the average aspiring trader spent less time on technical analysis and more time learning how to master their emotions, a higher percentage of us would be successful. Ultimately, I have no idea whether trading is a sustainable venture for me over the next 5-10 years, but learning how to manage your emotions is transferable to any aspect of life. Executing trades and repeatedly failing will equip you with the grit and strength to better handle adversity.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/trader.ftmo.com\/start-challenge?utm_source=Blog&amp;utm_medium=banner&amp;utm_campaign=FAQA\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-543706 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Blog-banner-Free-Trial-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"130\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Blog-banner-Free-Trial-1.jpg 800w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Blog-banner-Free-Trial-1-300x49.jpg 300w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Blog-banner-Free-Trial-1-768x125.jpg 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Blog-banner-Free-Trial-1-705x115.jpg 705w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Blog-banner-Free-Trial-1-24x4.jpg 24w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Blog-banner-Free-Trial-1-36x6.jpg 36w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Blog-banner-Free-Trial-1-48x8.jpg 48w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Trader Manuel: &#8220;Once you learn how to not trade when your setup isn\u2019t there you will begin to see consistency.&#8221;<\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-543387 size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Manuel-225x300.jpeg\" alt=\"Trader Manuel\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Manuel-225x300.jpeg 225w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Manuel-773x1030.jpeg 773w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Manuel-768x1024.jpeg 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Manuel-1152x1536.jpeg 1152w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Manuel-1536x2048.jpeg 1536w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Manuel-1125x1500.jpeg 1125w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Manuel-529x705.jpeg 529w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Manuel-18x24.jpeg 18w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Manuel-27x36.jpeg 27w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Manuel-36x48.jpeg 36w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Manuel-scaled.jpeg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px\" \/><\/p>\n<h4><strong>Do you plan to take another FTMO Challenge to manage even more capital?<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Absolutely, I\u2019m aiming for the maximum allocation.

So if you risk 1% per trade you know you can\u2019t be in more than 5 trades at once, otherwise you could blow your Max Daily Loss (5%). On my first Challenge I didn\u2019t do this, and I risked 1% on each trade and was in about 8 positions at one time and they were all in heavy drawdown and it blew the Challenge as it exceeded the 5% Max Daily Loss.
