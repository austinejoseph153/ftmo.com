Although most traders think they are losing money in trading because of flaws in their trading strategy, the truth is that in most cases they are not using proper risk management. In this article, we will cover everything you need to know about risk management in trading and how you can become a better trader.<\/em><\/p>\n<h2>Risk Management in Trading<\/h2>\n<p>Proper risk management in trading is what separates it from gambling.<\/p>\n<p>Even though we can never be sure of what markets are going to do next, by using proper risk management we can cover our potential losses and aim for wins that will make us profitable in a long run.<\/p>\n<h3>Undercapitalization<\/h3>\n<p>The first and the biggest problem of bad risk management is undercapitalization.<\/p>\n<p>Because a lot of brokerage firms offer deposits as small as $50, a lot of traders come into trading with $1,000 and think they can double or triple their capital very quickly.<\/p>\n<p>This leads to opening too big of positions where a short losing streak can cost you a whole <a href=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/en\/\">funded trading account<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>At FTMO, we are well aware of this and that\u2019s why we provide traders initial balance of up to $200,000.<\/p>\n<p>This way you can keep your risk per trade very small while still potentially achieving large gains.<\/p>\n<h3>Risk per trade<\/h3>\n<p>How much should you be risking per one trade?<\/p>\n<p>In most textbooks and online education programs, you will learn that you should not be risking more than 2% per one trade.<\/p>\n<p>Although the answer to this is more complicated, let\u2019s start with saying that 2% risk per trade is a good base to start with.<\/p>\n<p>As you can see from the below chart, keeping your risk at 2% per trade would only cost you approximately 20% of your account on 10 consecutive losses which should not happen in the first place for traders with robust trading strategy.<\/p>\n<p><a class=\"lightbox-added aligncenter\" href=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/210risk-e1618470841783.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-401672 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/210risk-e1618470841783.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"4004\" height=\"4022\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>However, if you decide to risk 10% per trade you would be down over 60%, and that would be a deep hole to dig yourself out of.<\/p>\n<p><a class=\"lightbox-added aligncenter\" href=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/returnrisk.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-401676 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/returnrisk.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 3904px) 100vw, 3904px\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/returnrisk.png 3904w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/returnrisk-300x256.png 300w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/returnrisk-1030x880.png 1030w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/returnrisk-768x656.png 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/returnrisk-1536x1312.png 1536w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/returnrisk-2048x1749.png 2048w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/returnrisk-1500x1281.png 1500w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/returnrisk-705x602.png 705w\" alt=\"\" width=\"3904\" height=\"3334\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>As you can see above, the percentage required to go back to break even as calculated from the remaining balance can be dangerously huge.<\/p>\n<p>Making 25% of your account back is not easy but it is still doable compared to the 150% required to break even after a 60% drawdown.<\/p>\n<p>Because there are no two organic traders with the same trading style, risk should differ based on strategy.<\/p>\n<p>If you are a scalper or day trader who takes 5 trades every single day, should you risk 2% per trade? Absolutely not.<\/p>\n<p>With this amount of trades, risking 2% is simply too much as you can experience large drawdowns very quickly.<\/p>\n<p>Daytraders and scalpers usually risk only 0.5-1% per trade.<\/p>\n<p>On the other hand, if you are a swing trader who only takes 1-2 trades per week, the 2% risk might be too small.<\/p>\n<p>If you know that the next trade will come up in a few days, you can probably bump your risk a little.<\/p>\n<p>But don\u2019t go too crazy, in general, the rule of thumb is that the risk per trade should not be over 5%, an exception to this could be if you are taking a long term investment.<\/p>\n<h3>Drawdowns<\/h3>\n<p>We all hate them but the truth is they are inevitable in trading and we must be well prepared for them.<\/p>\n<p><a class=\"lightbox-added aligncenter\" href=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Group-2846-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-401750\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Group-2846-1.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 4290px) 100vw, 4290px\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Group-2846-1.png 4290w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Group-2846-1-300x213.png 300w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Group-2846-1-1030x732.png 1030w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Group-2846-1-768x546.png 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Group-2846-1-1536x1092.png 1536w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Group-2846-1-2048x1456.png 2048w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Group-2846-1-1500x1066.png 1500w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Group-2846-1-260x185.png 260w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Group-2846-1-705x501.png 705w\" alt=\"\" width=\"4290\" height=\"3050\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>As you can see on the above table, if you have a trading strategy with a 60% probability win rate, there is still a 70% chance you will get four consecutive losses in a row.<\/p>\n<p>But things can be even more drastic if you are the type of trader with a 40% win rate, there is over 50% chance that you will have 8 consecutive losers in a row.<\/p>\n<p>Does that mean you cannot be profitable?
