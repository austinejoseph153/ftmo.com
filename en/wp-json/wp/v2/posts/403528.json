Before entering the trade I have to know where I am going to exit in case the trade goes against me. This step alone, makes me to be aware that I could be wrong and make me more cautious about the trading size.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What was the most difficult during your FTMO Challenge or Verification and how did you overcome it?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>There is real pressure from the time limit point of view and 10% in a month is quite challenging. This was a point of stress for me. Also, my father passed away during the challenge so I had to stop trading for a few days. I followed my plan despite the psychological pressure and traded in the bigger range of my usual trading size. I was lucky enough to get into a few good trades early in the challenge and passed the challenged without too much of a grind.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How did you eliminate the factor of luck in your trading?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We are working with probabilities here and it is completely impossible to eliminate completely the factor of luck, in my opinion. Having said that, the instruments that I traded most successfully (Bitcoin and Ethereum) are in a clear bull trend. I made sure that I was placing trades to take advantage of this trend. After a decent pullback, I thought the probabilities of capturing a nice leg up were pretty high.<\/p>\n<p><strong>One piece of advice for people starting the FTMO Challenge now.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>For me choosing the right instrument to trade helped more than any technical analysis. In retrospect I know that I took probably quite a bigger risk with my trading size than necessary and looking into the future I will be more conservative. I did it partly to pass the challenge faster but I know now that I could have been more patient and take smaller trades and probably pass in a similar amount of time.<\/p>\n<h3>Trader Stephon \u2013\u00a0<em>\u201cDon\u2019t look at this as a dollar amount look at it as percentages and never risk more than 1%.\u201d<\/em><\/h3>\n<p><a class=\"lightbox-added aligncenter\" href=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/stephonp.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-401053\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/stephonp-300x300.jpeg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/stephonp-300x300.jpeg 300w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/stephonp-1027x1030.jpeg 1027w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/stephonp-80x80.jpeg 80w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/stephonp-768x768.jpeg 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/stephonp-36x36.jpeg 36w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/stephonp-180x180.jpeg 180w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/stephonp-703x705.jpeg 703w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/stephonp.jpeg 1242w\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>How did you manage your emotions when you were in a losing trade?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>To be honest, managing my emotions when in losing trades was easy because I implemented strict risk management and the only thing I know For certain before entering any trade is exactly how much I\u2019m going to lose and I\u2019m always comfortable with that amount.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What was the most difficult during your FTMO Challenge or Verification and how did you overcome it?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>At the beginning of my challenge, I had a great start on my first trade so I got a big head and started being greedy trying to chase Bitcoin and went down almost 1200 my first morning I had to slow down I checked my client area and realized I was overtrading and I wasn\u2019t following my trading plan and once I was reminded of that it was pretty easy to adjust<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><a class=\"lightbox-added aligncenter\" href=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Stephonm.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-401056\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Stephonm.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 793px) 100vw, 793px\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Stephonm.png 793w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Stephonm-298x300.png 298w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Stephonm-80x80.png 80w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Stephonm-768x772.png 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Stephonm-36x36.png 36w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Stephonm-180x180.png 180w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Stephonm-701x705.png 701w\" alt=\"\" width=\"793\" height=\"797\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>Has your psychology ever affected your trading plan?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>During my journey as a trader, of course, it\u2019s hard not to but as far as the challenge tho o feel like it helped me be more disciplined and adjust my style based off the analytics which allowed me to be very comfortable and my psychology not be affected.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What was more difficult than expected during your FTMO Challenge or Verification?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This is my second time taking it so everything was exactly as I expected but the first time around it was the adjustment to the availability to that much capital and learning to use proper risk management<\/p>\n<p><strong>Do you plan to take another FTMO Challenge to manage even bigger capital?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Yes I intend on ultimately having a $400k account<\/p>\n<p><strong>One piece of advice for people starting the FTMO Challenge now.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Advice I would give for new people starting this challenge is not to look at this as a dollar amount look at it as percentages and never risk more then 1% I promise you it makes things so stress-free.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>\u201cNever risk more than 1%\u201d \u2013 that\u2019s the advice one of our new FTMO Traders shares.
