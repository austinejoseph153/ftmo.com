I usually am patient in the market, waiting for high quality set ups before executing a trade. I am a swing trader that looks for opportunities on the higher time frame (H4, Daily, sometimes Weekly).

That will give you more confidence in your trades as you are not second-guessing whether or not you want to get into a trade as you are afraid of losing that initial fee that you paid.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Trader Trevas: &#8220;Focus on your own journey, be open to learn and be ready to grow.&#8221;<\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-539042\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/Trevas-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/Trevas-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/Trevas-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/Trevas-705x470.jpg 705w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/Trevas-24x16.jpg 24w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/Trevas-36x24.jpg 36w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/Trevas-48x32.jpg 48w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/Trevas.jpg 900w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><b>Do you plan to take another FTMO Challenge to manage an even bigger capital?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes, my plan is to re-invest the profits that I make from this account and use them to fund other FTMO Challenges.

I do this by having my trading plan focus on two key areas: analysis and management. I split them despite their symbiotic nature to guarantee that I focus on one thing with all my focus at a time. This has helped me greatly to know what to do at what time or instance in the market, of course with discretion since no two trades are the same, I work out a decision based on my trading plan, journal it and at my end of the week review I learn from it so that I improve the overall quality of my trading.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-539072\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/Trevas-trades.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"913\" height=\"1213\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/Trevas-trades.png 913w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/Trevas-trades-226x300.png 226w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/Trevas-trades-775x1030.png 775w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/Trevas-trades-768x1020.png 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/Trevas-trades-531x705.png 531w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/Trevas-trades-18x24.png 18w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/Trevas-trades-27x36.png 27w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/Trevas-trades-36x48.png 36w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 913px) 100vw, 913px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><b>How has passing the FTMO Challenge and Verification changed your life?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It has taken my persistence and perseverance to a whole other level, and this not only in my trading but also in my life as a ripple effect reminding me to always stay focused on my goal and to never ever give up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>What was the most difficult during your FTMO Challenge or Verification and how did you overcome it?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Challenge was quite straightforward but it&#8217;s at the Verification where I thought it&#8217;d be straightforward but alas, I had a period of constant losses and to make it worse I gave my profit back to the market. This had an effect on my psychology but in the end I am glad that I went through that drawdown period because I learnt what to do when such an occasion happens in the future. The key lesson among the lessons I learnt was from your FTMO videos that whenever I trade 5 times regardless of whether they are wins or losses I ought to stop, take a break before diving back in. I integrated this into my plan and I am glad I did because it helped me see that I was overtrading and going for mediocre setups which ended up eating into my profits. This was an invaluable lesson and when I learnt this, I naturally created a process to refine my setups to work with the highest quality ones. With this lesson profits came flying back and I am really grateful for that video.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>What would you like to say to other traders that are attempting the Challenge?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take the steps one step at a time, the markets are always going to be there.

Focus on your own journey, be open to learn and be ready to grow.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Trader Bulind: &#8220;It&#8217;s part of the game, losing trades, break-even trades, and winning trades.&#8221;<\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-539049\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/Bulind-224x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"224\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/Bulind-224x300.jpg 224w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/Bulind-768x1030.jpg 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/Bulind-1145x1536.jpg 1145w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/Bulind-1527x2048.jpg 1527w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/Bulind-1118x1500.jpg 1118w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/Bulind-525x705.jpg 525w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/Bulind-18x24.jpg 18w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/Bulind-27x36.jpg 27w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/Bulind-36x48.jpg 36w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/Bulind-scaled.jpg 1908w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 224px) 100vw, 224px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><b>How would you rate your experience with FTMO?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was better than I expected it to be.
