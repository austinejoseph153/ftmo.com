Sometimes everything goes smoothly and one successful trade is followed by another, while other times it is just pain and suffering from watching a series of losing trades and the account being blown up.<\/span><\/em><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Every strategy has periods when it works almost flawlessly and generates profits, as well as periods when the trader has to deal with a series of losses. In general, however, it can be argued that when profitable trades outweigh losing trades (either in number or volume), the strategy is profitable in the long run.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Quick profits provide no guarantee of success<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The profitability of a strategy is therefore not only determined by the size of the profit it generates, but also by its performance during good and bad times. In other words, consistency of results is an important aspect for any strategy. This can be defined in different ways. One can check the last 100 trades, or assess the results for each quarter and from there determine whether the strategy is profitable or not over the long term.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having consistency is very important, as we can see in the examples of the following two strategies.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Strategy A:<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8211; A trader executes 1 trade a day using the same position size for 5 consecutive days.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8211; Account size: 100 000 USD<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8211; 5 trades<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8211; Profit 50 000 USD (50%)<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8211; Drawdown 50 000 USD (50%)<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/trader.ftmo.com\/start-challenge?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=banner&amp;utm_campaign=consistencyscore\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-546397 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_2-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"130\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_2-1.png 800w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_2-1-300x49.png 300w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_2-1-768x125.png 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_2-1-705x115.png 705w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_2-1-24x4.png 24w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_2-1-36x6.png 36w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_2-1-48x8.png 48w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><b>Strategy B:<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8211; A trader executes 1 trade a day using the same position size for 100 consecutive days.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8211; 100 trades<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8211; Profit 30 000 USD (30%)<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8211; Drawdown 10 000 USD (10%)<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although Strategy A makes much larger profits per trade, Strategy B performs better over a longer period of time with a lower drawdown, making the strategy less risky and more consistent.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Every trader should realise as soon as possible that the pursuit of quick profits increases the risk of a strategy and is not the path to long-term sustainable trading. In Strategy A, it can be clearly seen that it experienced a drawdown of 50% in just one week, which may sooner or later lead to an account reset.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">New Consistency Score in Account MetriX<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">FTMO has launched a new metric within the Account MetriX app called the \u201cConsistency Score\u201d, to enable\u00a0 traders to track their consistency. This indicator measures the trading consistency of each trader, with a higher value indicating a higher consistency of trades, which could help our traders to achieve better results, which should be the goal for anyone who wants to stay in the trading business for a longer period of time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The formula for calculation of the Consistency Score is simple: (1 \u2013 (absolute value of the most profitable or losing day \/ absolute result of all trading days)) x 100%.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Example:<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trader&#8217;s results:<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Day 1: +100<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Day 2: -500<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Day 3: +800<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-546748\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Consist-priklad-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"377\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Consist-priklad-1.jpg 2481w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Consist-priklad-1-300x141.jpg 300w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Consist-priklad-1-1030x486.jpg 1030w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Consist-priklad-1-768x362.jpg 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Consist-priklad-1-1536x724.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Consist-priklad-1-2048x966.jpg 2048w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Consist-priklad-1-1500x707.jpg 1500w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Consist-priklad-1-705x332.jpg 705w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Consist-priklad-1-24x11.jpg 24w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Consist-priklad-1-36x17.jpg 36w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Consist-priklad-1-48x23.jpg 48w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The biggest daily profit was 800.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The absolute sum of all trading days is 100 + 500 + 800 = 1400.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Consistency Score =(1-(800\/1400))x100 = 43%.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How the Consistency Score works<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If a trader\u2019s Consistency Score is 0%, it means that all of his profit was made on a single day.

FTMO values traders who can maintain a consistent approach in addition to profits. A great benefit for consistent traders is our <a href=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/en\/scaling-plan\/\">Scaling plan as well as the adjustment of the profit sharing<\/a><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> ratio to 90% in favour of the trader.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/en\/scaling-plan\/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=banner&amp;utm_campaign=consistencyscore\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-546367 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_3-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"130\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_3-1.png 800w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_3-1-300x49.png 300w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_3-1-768x125.png 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_3-1-705x115.png 705w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_3-1-24x4.png 24w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_3-1-36x6.png 36w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_3-1-48x8.png 48w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, traders do not have to worry about their success or whether meeting the requirements to pass the Evaluation Process will depend on their Consistency Score. A successful completion of the Evaluation Process is based on completing the basic <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/en\/#ftmo-section-objectives\">Trading Objectives of FTMO<\/a> and the Consistency Score is for informational purposes only.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some traders may feel that the Consistency Score may limit or discriminate against certain strategies, but this is certainly not its purpose. Striving for consistent results does not limit any trader from achieving above average returns. Yes, sometimes a trader may have an exceptionally successful trade in which he realises an above-average return, which may harm his Consistency Score. However, trading is not about one gain, and maintaining consistent results over a long period of time may not have a negative effect on the overall result.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When a trader trades successfully over a long period of time with an RRR of 2:1, for example, he may have an exceptional trade where he holds a profitable trade longer and reaches an RRR of 4:1. Since his strategy is set at an RRR of 2:1 (we assume he has tested it for a long time and knows what he is doing), this may be a lucky accident that may not be repeated and further attempts at such super trades may end in a series of unnecessary losses. It is not uncommon for unnecessary interventions in a working strategy in the pursuit of faster profits to lead to losses and, in the worst case, an account wipeout.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A consistent approach, on the other hand, can save a trader\u2019s account if he experiences a prolonged period of losses. When a trader decides to \u201ctake revenge on the market\u201d and starts opening unnecessarily large positions in pursuit of higher profits, he may face an account deletion, in the case of an FTMO Challenge or an FTMO Account.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is best illustrated by an example. Below we can see the results of an FTMO Account with a Consistency Score of 80.61%, and after a period when the trader did not do well, he almost reached the Maximum Loss limit. If he had traded larger positions, or started opening these larger positions after a series of losses, he would have certainly violated this important condition.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-546762\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Consist-graf.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"547\" height=\"634\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Consist-graf.png 547w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Consist-graf-259x300.png 259w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Consist-graf-21x24.png 21w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Consist-graf-31x36.png 31w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Consist-graf-41x48.png 41w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 547px) 100vw, 547px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But thanks to his consistent approach, he managed to get out of the drawdown and eventually made a great profit of $17,000. It is also clear from the above example that a trader does not have to have a completely smoothed yield curve with minimal fluctuations at all times to achieve a high Consistency Score.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/trader.ftmo.com\/start-challenge?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=banner&amp;utm_campaign=consistencyscore\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-546404 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_1-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"130\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_1-1.png 800w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_1-1-300x49.png 300w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_1-1-768x125.png 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_1-1-705x115.png 705w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_1-1-24x4.png 24w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_1-1-36x6.png 36w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_1-1-48x8.png 48w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Conclusion<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">FTMO is looking for serious traders who are able to manage risk responsibly and achieve consistent results over a long period of time.
