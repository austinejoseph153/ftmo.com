The key is recognizing your human limitations\u2026 as if every trade executed turned out to be profitable, you would never hesitate.<\/p>\n<p>I tell myself: <em>\u201cIf trading was a job and we offered 100 positions with a guaranteed five year, million dollars per year contract to work for a Forex firm, we would have millions of people banging down the doors or flooding the internet attempting to hit their lottery ticket seeking their shot at championship gold.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n<p>You would have nothing to fear and you would take decisive action.<\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, you&#8217;ve probably learned the hard way that professional traders aren\u2019t seeking employees, yet they are always looking for championship quality people trained to prosper in the most liquid market on earth\u2026 the recession-proof business of the 21st century known as the Forex.<\/p>\n<p>Attachment to money will begin to subside when you retrain your subconscious mind how to react to winning trades. Bottom line, you must learn how to accept the losers before you ever understand the winners.<\/p>\n<p>Those with practice regimen accounts execute trades in LIVE current market conditions as an exercise to build confidence in markets before trading their money.<\/p>\n<p>During your apprenticeship, you learn that you could have done all your work before executing a trade\u2026 and still end up losing pips. The possibility of being wrong and losing money shakes your confidence and stays with you.<\/p>\n<p>Major League Baseball players (like traders) must exhibit short term memory loss when facing failure. MLB players play 162 games over the course of a six month regular season, and if they\u2019re talented enough\u2026 they fail on an average of seven out of every ten times they step up to the plate.<\/p>\n<p>Their minds are focused. Traders have about 240 trading sessions per year and must remain focused\u2026 breaking down failure to understand success.<\/p>\n<p>So\u2026 Do you have a problem with hesitation in pushing the button when executing trades?<\/p>\n<p>Do you have a predetermined game plan in advance for each trade executed?<\/p>\n<p>Do you follow your trading strategy in practice accounts\u2026 and yet find you change your rules of engagement in LIVE accounts?<\/p>\n<p>Do you procrastinate until you execute a trade\u2026 and then are unable to leave your computer because you have to watch every tick movement of the currency pair you just traded?<\/p>\n<p>Do you need a sense of direction?<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s okay. Everyone does, some more than others\u2026 and like keeping a luxury car running\u2026 we all need mental checkups from time to time.<\/p>\n<p>Everyone, including myself.<\/p>\n<p>Take a deep breath and know a tune-up is within reach, if you make the choice.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This week, our trader Richard talks about attachment to money and how we as traders should focus more on actual trading instead of the money part of it.
