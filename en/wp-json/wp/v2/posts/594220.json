However, after a period of perseverance and adhering to my trading plan, I eventually adopted a more measured approach, factoring in the potential losses I could endure in each trade and eventually, I succeeded.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What was easier than expected during the FTMO Challenge or Verification?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s easier to pass the Challenge with fewer exceptions.

When the RR is not properly managed, your emotions will be very high. Sometimes it created a total vacuum in my life. Overtrading was the major reason for my emotional instability, and I overcame such situations by <a href=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/en\/mentor-app-is-essential-for-disciplined-traders\/\">replacing overtrading with disciplined trading<\/a>. Even if all the confluences were supporting and the trade goes in loss, I will always make a trade journal and evaluate my trading journey to understand where I have gone wrong. On that particular day, I won&#8217;t take any further trade and will be away with some other activities.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What inspires you to pursue trading?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I have gone through various challenges and the major was financial constraints. During that, I heard about Forex trading and attended the first seminar. As you know, being a novice trader, I was thrilled and excited to see the profitability and the way the presenter explained about the trade. Even though I had challenges, I managed to loan some amount and invest in Forex with one of the brokers. Within a few days, I lost the equity completely and I was in a dilemma with all the problems including financial challenges. I made a decision to learn Forex and it became a passion and I spent 10-12 hours daily up to one and a half years to learn the process. Also, I started watching YouTube Forex videos of successful traders including FTMO winners. This inspired me a lot and that was the start of my trading journey.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Do you have a trading plan in place, and do you follow it strictly?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Yes, I do have a trading plan and always try to grab max profits from one position in any selected instrument including commodity, currency, indices, etc. I will always select the time frame and trading hours and always closely watch the fundamentals about the selected instrument.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-594269\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Jomon-trades.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"906\" height=\"1326\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Jomon-trades.png 906w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Jomon-trades-205x300.png 205w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Jomon-trades-704x1030.png 704w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Jomon-trades-768x1124.png 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Jomon-trades-482x705.png 482w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 906px) 100vw, 906px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>How did you eliminate the factor of luck in your trading?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Seriously, I don\u2019t believe in any <a href=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/en\/what-role-does-luck-play-in-trading\/\">luck in trading<\/a> or any other business, rather it is pure effort, hard work, patience, and continuous learning.

Sometimes, the market reverses prior to hitting the set target and I have to do the entire analysis again from the very beginning.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What is the number one piece of advice you would give to a new trader?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>A novice trader always requires a mentor to guide him and to get disciplined. <a href=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/en\/are-you-new-to-trading-less-is-sometimes-more\/\">New traders should never think about creating wealth from the very first day of their trade<\/a>; rather they should concentrate on developing the skill, putting in a lot of effort and hard work to be successful. They must practice on Demo accounts including at FTMO, and once they build up the confidence, start trading at FTMO where they will learn patience and discipline in depth. Develop skill and wealth will follow.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/trader.ftmo.com\/start-challenge?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=banner&amp;utm_campaign=tradersqa\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-546397 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_2-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"130\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_2-1.png 800w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_2-1-300x49.png 300w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_2-1-768x125.png 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_2-1-705x115.png 705w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_2-1-24x4.png 24w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_2-1-36x6.png 36w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_2-1-48x8.png 48w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Trader Yaniel: \u201cOpportunities manifest themselves, and it is upon the trader to seize or forgo them.\u201d<\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-594239\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Yaniel-300x273.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"273\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Yaniel-300x273.jpg 300w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Yaniel-1030x937.jpg 1030w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Yaniel-768x699.jpg 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Yaniel-705x641.jpg 705w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Yaniel.jpg 1260w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Has your psychology ever affected your trading plan?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I believe the paramount factor and the foremost asset for a trader lies in their mindset.
