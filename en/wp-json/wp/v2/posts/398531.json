At this point, just trade your plan as normal. Keep a cool head. Adjust your risk if necessary to fit the drawdown criteria but enjoy the process and go in willing to learn!

That changes my mentality sufficiently to calculate a safe level of risk in my trading.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What do you think is the key for long term success in trading?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The key to long-term success is to always monitor your winning strategies for changes in performance. You must also continually learn and apply new strategies to add robustness to your trading in case of changing market conditions.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What would you like to say to other traders that are attempting the FTMO Challenge?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Risk management is key. You can always retry the challenge for free if you do not hit the profit target, but it&#8217;s game over if you have a string of bad trades that are too large of a lot size for your trading plan. Calculate the risk first, then place the trade. Make sure that you have insulated yourself properly from a bad trading day or week because they will happen at some point.<\/p>\n<h3>Trader Nicolas &#8211; <em>&#8220;The market does not respond to the emotions you are feeling that day whether they be positive or negative so it is critical to try your best to just remove emotions completely and be robot-like.&#8221;<\/em><\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/nicalsp.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-398554\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/nicalsp-157x300.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"157\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/nicalsp-157x300.jpeg 157w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/nicalsp-541x1030.jpeg 541w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/nicalsp-768x1463.jpeg 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/nicalsp-806x1536.jpeg 806w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/nicalsp-1075x2048.jpeg 1075w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/nicalsp-787x1500.jpeg 787w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/nicalsp-370x705.jpeg 370w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/nicalsp.jpeg 1080w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 157px) 100vw, 157px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>Do you have a trading plan in place, and do you follow it strictly?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Yes, I have created a strict trading plan in order to achieve my goal of stress-free trading. I trade the NY session Monday-Friday from 7 am-12 pm and only placing trades usually no earlier than 8 am.<\/p>\n<p>It took me a long time to develop a trading plan that I could stick to consistently and have success with. I do not deviate from this plan ever but am always trying new things and backtesting to see if there is anything to improve which there always is. I try not to set a certain dollar amount goal because I do not want to limit myself to making a certain amount. I want to maximize my capabilities without factoring in greed as much as possible.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How did you eliminate the factor of luck in your trading?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Along with what I said above in regards to my trading plan, I eliminate luck as best I can by using good risk management. At the end of the day, it is somewhat lucky that you are making money because I&#8217;ve learned anything can happen. It&#8217;s just a matter of managing your risk and realizing you can&#8217;t win every single trade so it is very important to not overleverage your account so when you do get that red trade, it is a small loss of maybe 1-3%, depending on my risk appetite is in correlation to account size. I learned as well that you are not going to get rich off of one trade so there is no reason to risk a large percentage of your account.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/nicolasm.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-398557\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/nicolasm.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"932\" height=\"934\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/nicolasm.jpg 932w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/nicolasm-300x300.jpg 300w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/nicolasm-80x80.jpg 80w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/nicolasm-768x770.jpg 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/nicolasm-36x36.jpg 36w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/nicolasm-180x180.jpg 180w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/nicolasm-703x705.jpg 703w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 932px) 100vw, 932px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>What was the most difficult during your FTMO Challenge or Verification and how did you overcome it?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I think the most difficult part of the challenge was when I was $50 away from completing the challenge and I took a $200 loss. I was pretty bummed because I was so close but I ended up finishing the challenge a couple of days after that. I think the most important part was that first trade and really trying to start the account off in the blue to give you that courage for the rest of the challenge. I feel the verification is not too hard because you already have so much confidence from completing the challenge.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How did you manage your emotions when you were in a losing trade?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I just kept my cool because I use the proper risk management and I know I just need at least about a 50% win rate to be profitable.

The main things I would have to say are risk management, no greed, and realizing these markets do not care about your bills or anything of that sort. The market does not respond to the emotions you are feeling that day whether they be positive or negative so it is critical to try your best to just remove emotions completely and be robot-like.<\/p>\n<p><strong>One piece of advice for people starting the FTMO Challenge now.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The only piece of advice I have for people starting the challenge is don&#8217;t give up.

The refund that I will get for this completed challenge will pay for the next challenge and so on.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Where have you learnt about FTMO?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>A fantastic company giving the likes of me a fantastic opportunity to trade with clout in the financial markets. There are hidden talents out there that only need that chance that platform to show what they can do. I\u2019ve been fascinated by the markets since I was 16 and remember well when George Soros broke the Bank of England and that has been what kick-started my interest. I have had numerous shots at trading using a personal account but not the leverage or capital to make it successful. Partly because I never took it that\u2019s serious with a professional mind to it and did not even have a trading plan or strategy. FTMO gives the environment and rules that allow for safe and proper capital management. Apply the right strategy and right rules and anybody can achieve it.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What is the number one advice you would give to a new trader?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Please please keep it simple 1. Have a trading plan as simple as it gets and make sure you\u2019ve applied it and tweaked it and it works in the sense it does generate profits. Set rules for entry and exit. 2. Risk management-key part of trading. Trading is not just about making money but also managing Croatian to avoid erosion. Use stop loss properly as a newbie. 3. Execute the trading plan and apply the rules irrespective of your own mindset. If your strategy works then trust it and stick by your own devised rules. Do not let your mindset influence your decisions, your strategy should do that. You will experience fear of missing out or fear of losing, panic and lack of patience but try to distract yourself rather than looking at your charts all for the time-as long your SL and TP is set. 4. Record your trades and the emotions behind it-I\u2019ve not done it enough myself but I reflect a lot about my trading journey where I went wrong or missed out and immediately change my practice on the next opportunity. 5. Review those trades that went well and stick with what worked and take out those bits that did not go well. Most of the time it will be the mindset and psychology that would be at fault. Get rid of any ego type thoughts or materialistic thoughts-it creates a risky mindset and tries to rush you through your journey. 6. Most importantly to it mindset, you have to believe in yourself your strategy and your desire to make it. Always try to see the bigger picture of you achieving and making it as a trader.
