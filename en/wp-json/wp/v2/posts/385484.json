Not a day goes by that I am not striving to be the best trader that I can be and trying to learn as much as I can to improve my skill set!<\/p>\n<p><strong>What is the number one advice you would give to a new trader?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Do not rush into trading with live funds until you have consistently shown profitability in a demo account for a pre-determined period of time. It could be anywhere from 3-6 months to a year or more, but you absolutely must learn to indoctrinate good trading habits from the beginning AND show consistency in your results before you try to risk real money. The money you save by doing this, in the long run, you can then put into your live trading account when you are ready, and potentially turn that into a much bigger profit!<\/p>\n<h3>Why Trader Connor picked FTMO over other Prop Firms?<\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-385501\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/connorp-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/connorp-225x300.jpg 225w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/connorp-768x1024.jpg 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/connorp-773x1030.jpg 773w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/connorp-529x705.jpg 529w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/connorp-450x600.jpg 450w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/connorp.jpg 960w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>How did you eliminate the factor of luck in your trading?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I spent countless hours learning one pair, understanding it&#8217;s nature, how it moves and when it moves. It has taken me a long time to understand it, but it is definitely worth the many late nights and early mornings.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What was easier than expected during the Challenge or Verification?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Actually reaching the targets is the hardest part, but breaking it down to how much you would need to make day by day, makes it much easier. Obviously, with trading, you should focus on the quality of the trade and not the money, but with the Challenge set as it is, breaking it down today by day amount, makes it sound much easier.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How does your risk management plan look like?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>If I take a market execution order, I aim to cut off at 0.5%. When taking a market execution order, the trade should move in your direction pretty swiftly, so if it doesn&#8217;t, then your position may be wrong. When I take a stop\/limit order, I will limit my loss to 2% if I cannot watch my position, which is also dependent on the trade itself. Most of the time, however, I will not go more than 1%.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-385502\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/connorm-1-1030x585.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1030\" height=\"585\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/connorm-1-1030x585.png 1030w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/connorm-1-300x170.png 300w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/connorm-1-768x436.png 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/connorm-1-705x400.png 705w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/connorm-1-450x255.png 450w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/connorm-1.png 1210w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1030px) 100vw, 1030px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Where have you learnt about FTMO?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I learned about FTMO when searching for prop trading companies. FTMO was the best option. Other firms have monthly fees, profit targets and fees if you do not reach them. I will feel freer under FTMO than I would any other company.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What was more difficult than expected during your Challenge or Verification?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Learning to cope with using larger lot sizes. This was not my first challenge, but understanding how to adjust and mentally cope with larger losses was tough at first. However, with this: it made me understand price action much better, and therefore I avoided many losses in the process. By doing so, I may have only take a few pips in some places, but it was much better than losing money.<\/p>\n<p><strong>One piece of advice for people starting the Challenge now.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Drop your ego and stop wanting to be right all the time, sometimes the market will have different ideas to what you had. Believe in yourself. Have confidence. Be rigid with your risk management but flexible with your entry points. Learn one pair inside out &#8211; this is the best way to do it in my opinion. Become incredibly good at trading one pair &#8211; then, when you are established, feel free to focus on new pairs. Never stop learning!<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Trader Juan describes his experience with FTMO<\/h3>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-385503\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Juanp-224x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"224\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Juanp-224x300.jpg 224w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Juanp-768x1030.jpg 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Juanp-1119x1500.jpg 1119w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Juanp-526x705.jpg 526w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Juanp-450x603.jpg 450w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 224px) 100vw, 224px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>What was more difficult than expected during your Challenge or Verification?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>One of the most difficult parts of the experience was the Verification Process. I fell down to just about $150 in equity before failing the max loss on the account. Here I was really able to analyze what lead to me to be back down so much. I was able to shift my managing skills and stick to my plan so I could pass the objectives.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How did you manage your emotions when you were in a losing trade?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Before going into a trade I have already calculated what I&#8217;m risking on the trade. I have gotten better able handling drawdowns and knowing price will do its thing no matter what. Calculating risk on the trade just helps me know that even if I lose the trade I can analyze what went wrong and learn from the hit. Risk and money management is key here and it helps keep me a clear head.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What inspires you to pursue trading?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The freedom and the compounding effect it can have an account is what inspired me to want to trade. At first, it was just starting as a hobby but now I know the full impact on my life. I have been able to help my parents and myself to put me through school. I love it.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-385504\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/juanm-1030x582.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1030\" height=\"582\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/juanm-1030x582.png 1030w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/juanm-300x169.png 300w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/juanm-768x434.png 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/juanm-705x398.png 705w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/juanm-450x254.png 450w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/juanm.png 1208w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1030px) 100vw, 1030px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>How would you rate your experience with FTMO?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The experience with FTMO has been great.
