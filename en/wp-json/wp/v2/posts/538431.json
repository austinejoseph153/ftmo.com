The number 1 rule of investing is to protect your capital. This can only be done by cutting your losses and letting your profits run. I always ensure that my R:R (Risk to Reward) is minimum 1:4. As this allows me to lose a few trades and still be in profit from just one trade alone.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Describe your best trade.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I was trading in the 4HR timeframe and was in drawdown, though there were two trades that were congruent with my trading plan and tested all my confluences cleanly. Therefore, I executed that trade, however this time I increased the risk from 1% to 3% as high risk = high reward and this led to a 22% gain over the course of 2 days. However, I still think that it is always best to trade conservatively in order to have consistent gains in the long term. It was just that back then I had a specific target to reach.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What do you think is the most important characteristic\/attribute to become a profitable trader?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Honestly, resilience. Trust me, the number of times I wanted to give up or thought this was not for me because I wasn&#8217;t getting the results. I wanted yet I saw a lot of people on social media get them. You, honestly, just need to keep going, never give up. One quote that has always been in my head and on my whiteboard that always keeps me going is: &#8220;winners never quit, and quitters never win&#8221; it just makes so much sense, because how can you ever win anything in life if you quit. Then I imagine the greats like Michael Jordan or Usain Bolt, like, imagine if halfway through the 100m dash Usain Bolt decided to quit, then how would he ever win if he quit, and he wouldn&#8217;t have even known that he was the fastest man alive. That\u2019s crazy. So yeah &#8211; winners never quit. And you are a winner so do not quit!<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-538995 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Harry-trades-II.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"914\" height=\"1223\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Harry-trades-II.png 914w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Harry-trades-II-224x300.png 224w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Harry-trades-II-770x1030.png 770w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Harry-trades-II-768x1028.png 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Harry-trades-II-527x705.png 527w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Harry-trades-II-18x24.png 18w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Harry-trades-II-27x36.png 27w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Harry-trades-II-36x48.png 36w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 914px) 100vw, 914px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>What inspires you to pursue trading?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Freedom.

Again, all I could do is follow the process, losses are inevitable, but the success of the strategy was shown as I turned it around from 93k to 110k to complete the challenge.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What does your risk management plan look like?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I risk 1% per trade, I trade without discretion, so essentially if a trade fits my plan, I will take the trade without hesitation. Win or loss is not a major factor because through backtesting I know that the individual trade does not matter, over a large sample size I will be consistently profitable.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Has your psychology ever affected your trading plan?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Yes, with previous strategies it has. But with my current strategy, I am trading with guerrilla trading, and what is great is that there is no discretion, meaning that individual trades have less impact, furthermore, at guerrilla we are low risk traders, so taking losses in a row is something that can occur, but the winning trades are uncapped, which allows the strategy to provide consistent profitability.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-539009 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Ubaid-trades-II.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"910\" height=\"1218\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Ubaid-trades-II.png 910w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Ubaid-trades-II-224x300.png 224w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Ubaid-trades-II-770x1030.png 770w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Ubaid-trades-II-768x1028.png 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Ubaid-trades-II-527x705.png 527w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Ubaid-trades-II-18x24.png 18w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Ubaid-trades-II-27x36.png 27w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Ubaid-trades-II-36x48.png 36w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 910px) 100vw, 910px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>How has passing the FTMO Challenge and Verification changed your life?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Passing has challenged my life in a massive way, it has allowed me to leave my 9-5 job and trade full time!<\/p>\n<p><strong>Describe your best trade.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I wouldn\u2019t say I have the best trade, because for me it\u2019s just the probabilities playing out.
