I have been always used to MetaTrader, and the fact that FTMO just added some new cryptocurrency assets that i can trade with is amazing.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What was the most difficult during your FTMO Challenge or Verification and how did you overcome it?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I think the most difficult part was understanding the risk management in place. Most traders fail this challenge due to high risk. Moreover, it is more about understanding the timings you can trade with your account. I printed out the timetable along with a risk management calculator. This really helped me achieve both steps in 10 minimum trading days.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Has your psychology ever affected your trading plan?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It used to a lot. I am a full believer that trading is 99% psychology and 1% technical.

However, I know that new setups happen every day and it\u2019s about staying in the game for as long as possible that matters, not the home run trade.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Do you plan to take another FTMO Challenge to manage even bigger capital?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Yes I\u2019m in the process of another challenge as I\u2019m writing this.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How did you eliminate the factor of luck in your trading?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Backtesting, backtesting, backtesting. It\u2019s KEY! Once you find what works and based on your personality, life and financial goals, if it works for you and it allows you to live comfortably then hone in on it and master it. I didn\u2019t say stick to it because the markets are always changing but master that setup, indicator, timeframe or news release. Whichever way you trade, to elongate the factor of risk one needs to have a proven edge and the only way to do that is through backtesting and having a proven strategy. Don\u2019t give up when it fails but go back to the drawing board.<\/p>\n<p><a class=\"lightbox-added aligncenter\" href=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Alainm.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-403018\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Alainm.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 890px) 100vw, 890px\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Alainm.png 890w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Alainm-300x278.png 300w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Alainm-768x711.png 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Alainm-705x653.png 705w\" alt=\"\" width=\"890\" height=\"824\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>Has your psychology ever affected your trading plan?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>No, my psychology was in check most of the time and even upon almost reaching my max daily loss. I was happy with the trades I took and I\u2019d take them again because I know over time they will work out. So no my psychology wasn\u2019t affected but in previous times, taking losses was my worst struggle to overcome and that maybe why I\u2019m so calm when I lose now. Fear of failure is real and that can tie in with not accepting a loss because you want to be right. It\u2019s all probabilities in the markets, you won\u2019t get 10 coin flip guesses right 10 times in row. So play out the probabilit\u00e9s and ride the wins and stay strong through the losses because they will come.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What was the most difficult during your FTMO Challenge or Verification and how did you overcome it?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Nothing, luckily for me I felt ready mentally and physically. I had been peeping myself for the challenge and that market conditions were beautiful so everything fell in place. I took the same trades on my personal account so for me, this was all real as money was definitely on the line for me.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What is the number one piece of advice you would give to a new trader?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Having done and failed a few challenges, my one piece of advice for new traders would be have patients in the markets and for yourself to get to the level you think you are at in your head. Prepare, through backtesting, chart analysis maybe checking news and most importantly prepare to take the challenge. In most cases, like an athlete, one would take several weeks, months or years to get prepared to compete and they don\u2019t quit when they lose a race but they HAVE to be prepared through vigour sand constant repetitive training. So have the right discipline to put yourself and your future first because this is life-changing stuff and reap the benefits later.
