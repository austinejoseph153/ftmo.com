But, I really enjoyed my GBP\/NZD short on the first step, I had 7 confluences to take it that made me us nearly +3,5% profit. Here was my trade analysis: After a break and retest of the descending Trendline, break of a massive head &amp; shoulders&#8217; neckline, creation of a smaller h&amp;s pattern supported by a key resistance, and my two favorite moving averages the price could fall nicely to the 1,91539 price zone.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/hassanm.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-396089\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/hassanm.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"929\" height=\"859\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/hassanm.jpg 929w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/hassanm-300x277.jpg 300w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/hassanm-768x710.jpg 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/hassanm-705x652.jpg 705w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 929px) 100vw, 929px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>Has your psychology ever affected your trading plan?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>As I said above, sticking to my plan and my precise risk management, I didn&#8217;t really feel my psychology interfering with my trades even while I was in a small drawdown.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How does passing the FTMO Challenge and Verification changed your life?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It helped me prove to myself what I was and what I am capable of.

I have also trained myself to become numb to both my winning and losing trades, if you can\u2019t manage your emotions while you are winning, it will be even harder to manage them whilst you are losing.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How does your risk management plan look like?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I aim to risk a maximum of 0.5% per trade.<\/p>\n<p>This risk management plan ensures that I have low risk per trade, but high profits when successful.<\/p>\n<p>This suits my trading plan best as I aim to catch 80+ pips per trade with tight stop losses between 10-40 pips so in the region of minimum 1:2 to 1:8+ risk to reward ratio on my setups.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/malaikahp.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-396095\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/malaikahp.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"935\" height=\"876\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/malaikahp.jpg 935w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/malaikahp-300x281.jpg 300w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/malaikahp-768x720.jpg 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/malaikahp-705x661.jpg 705w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 935px) 100vw, 935px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>What was the most difficult during your FTMO Challenge or Verification and how did you overcome it?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The most challenging part of the Challenge and Verification is remaining disciplined and sticking to your trading plan.<\/p>\n<p>I set out my trading plan before starting both. Trading involves psychological warfare, focus, and discipline are key to overcoming the mental barriers we have stopping us from remaining disciplined.<\/p>\n<p>This involves, sticking to your analysis, not revenge trading, ensuring each trade taken was thought about rather than gambling. Once you can overcome these psychological barriers, you can overcome anything.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What do you think is the key to long-term success in trading?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The key to long term success is having a trading log.<\/p>\n<p>Documenting all of your trading and reflecting on them at the end of each day.<\/p>\n<p>From this you are able to learn from your mistakes, evaluate why your losing trades were losing trades and why your most successful trades were successful. Through evaluating, logging and tracking you can start to understand yourself better as a trader and your thought process.<\/p>\n<p>I also believe developing daily habits which you repeat consistently day in day out such as waking up early, pre-planning your setups for the week on the weekend when market is closed and time tracking how much time you are putting in on the charts each day and not just focusing on the results will give you long term growth.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How would you rate your experience with FTMO?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>10\/10 &#8211; FTMO has tested my limits and overcome them.

I really enjoy the analytical tools provided through FTMO and used those to further my understanding of where I\u2019m strongest and weakest to help in making future trades.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How does your risk management plan look like?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>My risk management plan is fairly simple.<\/p>\n<p>Before each trade, depending on how many confirmations I have aligned and how good I feel about it, I will risk between 0.5-1.5%.<\/p>\n<p>I never risk more than 1.5%, and I pay close attention to my daily risk limit to make sure I don\u2019t go past that if I happen to lose all of my active trades. I use an app called Stinu to calculate how much I can risk based on a specific stop-loss pip number I have counted up before placing any trade.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What would you like to say to other traders that are attempting the FTMO Challenge?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I think that the most important thing other traders should do is make sure they place a pending order for their trades with a stop-loss and take profit, and rarely (if ever) market execute any trades. The next most important thing I believe is for them to walk away for a while because retail traders always tend to overthink their trade when they\u2019re watching it live. Find a strategy you like, suck it up and create your own trading plan (actually type it out, put it in a binder, and follow it strictly), and analyze both your winning and losing trades afterwards to see if there is anywhere that you\u2019d like to alter your trading plan after each month. Try to take the emotions out by ensuring that you are comfortable with losing whatever amount you\u2019re risking BEFORE placing a trade.<\/p>\n<h3>Trader Ahmed &#8211; never jump in without a proper plan<\/h3>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/ahmedp.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-396110\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/ahmedp-246x300.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"246\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/ahmedp-246x300.jpeg 246w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/ahmedp-846x1030.jpeg 846w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/ahmedp-768x935.jpeg 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/ahmedp-1232x1500.jpeg 1232w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/ahmedp-579x705.jpeg 579w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/ahmedp.jpeg 1242w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 246px) 100vw, 246px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>What was the most difficult during your FTMO Challenge or Verification and how did you overcome it?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The most difficult thing was, trying to cope with winning a streak.<\/p>\n<p>Since as everyone know that when you trade and you\u2019re on a winning streak.<\/p>\n<p>A psychological thing happens called strategy slips.<\/p>\n<p>The way I overcame it is by trying to always remind myself that even though I\u2019m on a winning streak, losses can rack up quickly if I get unfocused.
