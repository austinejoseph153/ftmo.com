I do not want to be on the other side of the spectrum (retail traders). One rule of thumb to remember is: statistics say 90% of traders lose their capital in the first 90 days of their trading career.<\/p>\n<p>Keep that in perspective and always at the back of your mind. The market is designed to make you lose, so be careful. Expect losses, but fire back with greatness!<\/p>\n<p><strong>How does passing the FTMO Challenge and Verification changed your life?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This will bring big changes for me overall.<\/p>\n<p>Being able to trade on a live $100,000 account is quite substantial. It allows me to remain calm because then I&#8217;m not overleveraging on a smaller sized account. FTMO is like a big-time boost in the Foreign Exchange industry.<\/p>\n<p>It will definitely make more trader&#8217;s dreams come true and in a lot quicker manner! So thank you, FTMO for that!<\/p>\n<p>So please I ask you, take advantage of such a wonderful opportunity. I promise you won&#8217;t regret it. Being able to pass this challenge and verification is not an easy task. I believe about 90% of traders fail it. One thing the Challenge and Verification have done for me is it made me a more disciplined trader overall.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/traderandrew.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-398078\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/traderandrew.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"925\" height=\"895\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/traderandrew.jpg 925w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/traderandrew-300x290.jpg 300w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/traderandrew-768x743.jpg 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/traderandrew-36x36.jpg 36w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/traderandrew-705x682.jpg 705w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 925px) 100vw, 925px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>What do you think is the key for long-term success in trading?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Being able to stick to a game plan.<\/p>\n<p>What I mean by this, is a trading plan.<\/p>\n<p>Use relatively the same lot size per trade, and never force trades that are out of the ordinary.<\/p>\n<p>I think the hardest thing traders can&#8217;t manage while trading, is their psychology.<\/p>\n<p>It is a hard thing to master, but it&#8217;s a value you gain with practice over the long run. One important thing I want to share with all of you is: this market plays very deep in your mind. I want to talk to you about sports.<\/p>\n<p>When you hear the saying in baseball: &#8220;3 strikes and you&#8217;re out&#8221; per example. You know the batter is out in the game. The market works in similar ways. We as humans respond to things, typically when things happen in a row.<\/p>\n<p>I want to let you know the market works similarly.<\/p>\n<p>And it&#8217;s in response mechanism to mainly fear and greed are the driving factors of the market. People that invented the markets in my opinion knew the background of true human psychology and how their emotions play intact. So yes, risk management is important.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How did you manage your emotions when you were in a losing trade?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Most of my trades only run for 2-8 hours maximum at a time.<\/p>\n<p>If I&#8217;m not in profit within the first 2 hours when market makers have dealt their cards to me.<\/p>\n<p>I fold my cards and move on to the next trade. This process makes it&#8217;s very easy for me to manage emotions. Because my trades move quickly in pip value, I don&#8217;t have to worry about checking the trade too often.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Has your psychology ever affected your trading plan?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Absolutely. When I first started my trading journey.<\/p>\n<p>I used to have quite a bit of loss.<\/p>\n<p>My strategy was fine, but when I would lose.<\/p>\n<p>I would revenge trade or have a fear of missing out on the market (FOMO).<\/p>\n<p>I have educated myself quite a bit since first trading.<\/p>\n<p>Now I use higher probability set-ups, and that gives me a major sigh of relief\/edge in the markets! This makes my mind crystal clear, and I try to visualize trades before they happen.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What is the number one advice you would give to a new trader?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Practice your strategy on a demo account for roughly 3-6 months first.<\/p>\n<p>I think too many traders dive into this market thinking they can make quick money because society says so.<\/p>\n<p>Anything quick money, in the financial world leads to the equation of overall loss. You won&#8217;t last in this industry thinking in that mindset\/state of mind. Once you have succeeded in trading on your demo account.<\/p>\n<p>Open a small live account. I would say $500 is just fine with any broker to get started. Use smaller lots like .01 sizing.<\/p>\n<p>Trade on the live account for 3-6 months.<\/p>\n<p>Watch the account grow, and then take an FTMO challenge to get funded and hone your skills.<\/p>\n<p>Another tip: lots of misinformation is spread about the Foreign Exchange market designed to make you lose.<\/p>\n<p>Whether it&#8217;s endless strategies, broker manipulation, fraudulent companies running a pyramid scheme.<\/p>\n<p>You name it, you&#8217;ll find it everywhere. Let&#8217;s talk about broker manipulation overall.<\/p>\n<p>Any broker will hate me for publicly discussing this but let&#8217;s take a stab at it.<\/p>\n<p>Why would a broker want you to sign up with a bonus deposit and high leverage attached to it? Once again, it&#8217;s quick money thinking.<\/p>\n<p>They want (you) the trader, to think Forex is easy to make a lot of money.<\/p>\n<p>So let&#8217;s give them more leverage then they can handle psychology wise and then BOOM the broker burns the stops and your money is lost.<\/p>\n<p>This is just one example of how Forex is highly manipulated.<\/p>\n<p>Overall, have fun trading. Remember, losses come and go. Just aim to achieve more wins than losses.<\/p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t stress, you got this! The world is changing drastically, and soon enough many jobs will become obsolete. So, gain a skill set that will pay you for a lifetime! Many blessings to all of you on your journey to becoming the &#8216;FTMO trader&#8217;.<\/p>\n<h3>Trader Yong &#8211; <em>&#8220;All it takes is hard work, discipline, patience, and resilience.&#8221;<\/em><\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/yongp-scaled.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-398057\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/yongp-225x300.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/yongp-225x300.jpeg 225w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/yongp-774x1030.jpeg 774w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/yongp-768x1022.jpeg 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/yongp-1154x1536.jpeg 1154w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/yongp-1539x2048.jpeg 1539w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/yongp-1127x1500.jpeg 1127w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/yongp-530x705.jpeg 530w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/yongp-scaled.jpeg 1923w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>What do you think is the key for long-term success in trading?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>All it takes is hard work, discipline, patience, and resilience.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How does your risk management plan look like?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I risk 1-1.5% per trade, my maximum risk exposure per day would be around 3-3.5% the max.

Win or lose. Until I got closer to the goal of 10%, then I started going out of the trades cause I got scared. I will be honest. But, going around in my head with myself made me solve this.

I know feelings are hard to suppress, as they were for me. But this is possible so have a clear goal of what you will do in the future managing trading.
