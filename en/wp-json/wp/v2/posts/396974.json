It&#8217;s an oxymoron that people want to make fast profits quickly, yet the quickest profits you can ever make happen down the road when you compound your account. Compounding = Time x Consistency. So it&#8217;s about the long-term consistency that will compound big gains, not the next trade.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How did Maximum loss limits affect your trading style?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Made me a lot of a better trader, before if I was a little more flexible that will not pass with FTMO so I had to really force myself in the nitty-gritty and have all my ducks lined up in a row.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How does your risk management plan look like?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>2% \/ 1% \/ .5% Rule: You can risk 2% until you lose, then you drop to 1% risk until you made back at least (1\/2) of your 2% loss. If you made (1\/2) of your loss back you can go back to 2%. If you lost again at 1% you drop down to .5% and stay at .5% until you make back your loss. This way it dramatically reduces your drawdown curve and is one of my secret strategies. With FTMO I use more like 1% \/ .50% \/ .25% because of the max daily limits rules<\/p>\n<p><strong>What was the most difficult during your FTMO Challenge or Verification and how did you overcome it?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>MY psychology for sure.

Therefore, trading has become more like a lifestyle to me than just a hobby. And now I am on my way to become a full-time trader.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Do you plan to take another FTMO Challenge to manage even bigger capital?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Yes definitely! I love challenges &amp; of course with bigger capital comes with bigger responsibility. It allows me to evolve exponentially in all aspects. I&#8217;m grateful that I&#8217;ve been awarded this opportunity to be able to trade on behalf of FTMO alongside other traders and of course for great profit sharing too.

So in essence, I believe the key for long term success in trading is to be able to consistently focus and follow your trading plans, trust your system after you back-tests it again and again. And most importantly to detach yourself from the market.<\/p>\n<p>Focus. Consistency. Profits. Repeat. And I believe that is where I am now in growing myself to become a more profitable trader.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What was the most difficult during your FTMO Challenge or Verification and how did you overcome it?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I wouldn&#8217;t say it is the most difficult because learning to get better at it with time. It&#8217;s the time period window to achieve a certain amount, I think.<\/p>\n<p>Probably because I&#8217;m not used to set a target in a period of time so the pressure I must say it is both exciting and fun too.<\/p>\n<p>Also the fact that my trades are for medium to short term but with your challenges have pushed me harder to a limit that I will learn to ensure myself to become an intraday profitable trader much sooner. So with your Challenge &amp; Verification stages, I believe I have improved well in terms of achieving the target in a shorter time period because now I have a target.<\/p>\n<p>A lot more of improvements to come, I believe I&#8217;m a fast learner too.
