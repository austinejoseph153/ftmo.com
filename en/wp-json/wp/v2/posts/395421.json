Due to the loss limits put forth, I was able to stay disciplined and never over trade. I only traded the setups that I felt were most important and if they happened to go against me, I would step away and clear my mind until the next trading day, this allowed me to start fresh with new limitations.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What was easier than expected during the Challenge or Verification?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The verification was by far easier and that was because you are given much more time to make half the profit of the challenge. This gave you more room to rank and determine the trades in which you want to take.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Where have you learned about FTMO?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I found FTMO around two years ago while searching for ways to trade with larger funds. It was always my goal since then to become a funded trader once I felt ready.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/thomasm.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-395425 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/thomasm.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1014\" height=\"995\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/thomasm.png 1014w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/thomasm-300x294.png 300w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/thomasm-80x80.png 80w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/thomasm-768x754.png 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/thomasm-36x36.png 36w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/thomasm-705x692.png 705w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1014px) 100vw, 1014px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>Describe your best trade.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>My best trade is not my most profitable trade but my most satisfying trade. When catching a set up on a daily time frame, I took a buy on USDCHF. This trade was given a larger stop loss and a smaller lot size because of the wide stop. For over a week, price bounced up and down, in and out of drawdown ending the week in continuous consolidation. The next week when the markets opened, the price finally took off to where I expected, and I was able to take profits. This was very satisfying.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What was more difficult than expected during your Challenge or Verification?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Where to take a profit and where to leave a trade-in for further potential profit. Due to having a time limit, you cannot risk having trades stop at breakeven as you need the profit target to be reached within the challenge and verification.<\/p>\n<p><strong>One piece of advice for people starting the Challenge now.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Do not start unless you are confident in yourself, your trading analysis, your plan and your risk management skills. Trading with large amounts of money is completely different from trading with a small personal account. Try a demo with larger amounts of money first. Follow the rules set forth by FTMO and see if you are able to \u201cpass\u201d your own challenge.<\/p>\n<h3>Trader Henry from the US<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/henry\u00fa-scaled.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-395428\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/henry\u00fa-225x300.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/henry\u00fa-225x300.jpeg 225w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/henry\u00fa-774x1030.jpeg 774w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/henry\u00fa-768x1022.jpeg 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/henry\u00fa-1154x1536.jpeg 1154w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/henry\u00fa-1539x2048.jpeg 1539w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/henry\u00fa-1127x1500.jpeg 1127w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/henry\u00fa-530x705.jpeg 530w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/henry\u00fa-scaled.jpeg 1923w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>How does your risk management plan look like?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Risk management is very important, and I range it from 0.05%-1% per trade.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Do you have a trading plan in place, and do you follow it strictly?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Yes, all confluences must be met in order to find the great deals available in the market.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What was more difficult than expected during your Challenge or Verification?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The most difficult part for me was the daily equity limits.
