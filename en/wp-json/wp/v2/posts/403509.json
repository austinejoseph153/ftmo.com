I had unnecessary pressure in my head and I did let emotions play with me at the beginning because I was thinking too much because of the time limit. That even made me play with my trade plan and I changed it for the challenge.<\/p>\n<p>But as soon as I did figure out, that the problem is overthinking I changed back to my original trade plan, which I feel comfortable with and as soon as I did that, at that point, everything was running smoothly like it supposed to.<\/p>\n<p>I was able to finish the challenge and I had a completely different mindset approaching at verification stage and that led to finishing verification on the 4th day.

Thanks to you guys!<\/p>\n<p><strong>How did you eliminate the factor of luck in your trading?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>So yeah, in trading that is not the only thing u need to eliminate if u want to become consistently profitable and that\u2019s the beauty in trading because not many people can eliminate emotions like fear or greed. Sometimes factor of good or bad luck will play part in our trading, and that\u2019s a normal thing. We can\u2019t control the markets and we just need to stick to our strategy and trade plan and let probabilities play out.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What is the number one advice you would give to a new trader?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Patience is the key to success in this business! Just don\u2019t rush the process. The good thing needs time and just let time do its work. First focus on learning everything and then find a strategy and start backtesting it. Throw backtesting u will build up your confidence and your trade plan. Then u need to find your daily routine and u need to stick to it! For that, you will need a lot of discipline and just do your work and repeat it every day. When u do all thing above then focus on psychology and emotions. Everyone can learn technical analysis and risk management, but if you are letting your emotions get the best out of you you will certainly fail. So train your mind and combine it with all thing above and u will be set for success! A complete trader needs a lot of small things to be consistently profitable and if u miss or ignore one thing u will most certainly fail. Fail to prepare, prepare to fail.<\/p>\n<h3>Trader Clement \u2013\u00a0<em>\u201cI don\u2019t focus on the monetary amount but solely on the charts.\u201d<\/em><\/h3>\n<p><a class=\"lightbox-added aligncenter\" href=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/clementp.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-400817\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/clementp-300x190.jpeg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/clementp-300x190.jpeg 300w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/clementp-1030x651.jpeg 1030w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/clementp-768x485.jpeg 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/clementp-705x446.jpeg 705w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/clementp.jpeg 1242w\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"190\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>What inspires you to pursue trading?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Besides the given opportunity for financial independence, financial freedom, low-cost business model and mobile flexibility, what inspires me are the incredible unique tool trading is for self-mastery.
