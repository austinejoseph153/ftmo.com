However, one of the underestimated factors remains the\u00a0<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/en\/what-to-watch-out-for-when-it-comes-to-rrr\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reward to Risk Ratio<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which is one of the most important tools of money management and risk management for every trader.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Do you have the RRR set properly?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You have probably read articles on what RRR is considered to be best for Forex traders, with the most commonly recommended RRR being 3:1 or 2:1. These are reasonable values where a trader can be quite conservative in setting his SL (it doesn\u2019t have to be too tight), and Take Profits at the same time don\u2019t have to be too hard to achieve.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/trader.ftmo.com\/start-challenge?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=banner&amp;utm_campaign=rrrconsistency\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-543692 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Blog-banner-Challenge-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"130\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Blog-banner-Challenge-1.jpg 800w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Blog-banner-Challenge-1-300x49.jpg 300w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Blog-banner-Challenge-1-768x125.jpg 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Blog-banner-Challenge-1-705x115.jpg 705w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Blog-banner-Challenge-1-24x4.jpg 24w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Blog-banner-Challenge-1-36x6.jpg 36w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Blog-banner-Challenge-1-48x8.jpg 48w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>A higher RRR is not the basis for success<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While a higher RRR looks great on paper, only a few traders are able to maintain it consistently over the long term without closing their positions unnecessarily early or \u201cmanaging\u201d them in some other way. Yes, it\u2019s great to make 10 times what you could lose on a trade. However, in reality, this means that you will either set a very tight SL or you will rarely get close to your Take Profit, which can be very challenging psychologically. So you will make a relatively large amount of money in one trade, but the series of losses that will precede it can be hard to digest for many traders.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some people, on the other hand, may be comfortable with a lower RRR, such as 1:1, because it is important for them to make profits more often, even if their profits are not very high. Again, it\u2019s all about psychology. In general, some perfect RRR universally suitable for all traders cannot be determined. Everyone has a different preference and risk profile, and the appropriate RRR will depend on that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/trader.ftmo.com\/start-challenge?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=banner&amp;utm_campaign=rrrconsistency \" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-546404 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_1-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"130\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_1-1.png 800w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_1-1-300x49.png 300w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_1-1-768x125.png 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_1-1-705x115.png 705w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_1-1-24x4.png 24w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_1-1-36x6.png 36w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_1-1-48x8.png 48w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Consistency as the basis for success<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When we talk about consistency as one of the basic factors of a trader\u2019s success, we also mean consistent RRR, which a trader should clearly set according to his preferences and trading goals. With a consistent RRR, a trader can predict the probability of success of his trades and can calculate the percentage of successful and unsuccessful trades he needs to be profitable in the long run. At the same time, he can avoid trades where the risk is too high relative to the potential return, which again limits the number of unnecessarily losing trades. All of this will help him to fine-tune his strategy and ultimately give him the psychological comfort that is critical to long-term profitability.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/en\/scaling-plan?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=banner&amp;utm_campaign=rrrconsistency\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-546367 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_3-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"130\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_3-1.png 800w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_3-1-300x49.png 300w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_3-1-768x125.png 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_3-1-705x115.png 705w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_3-1-24x4.png 24w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_3-1-36x6.png 36w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_3-1-48x8.png 48w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Improved FTMO Quick Trade Manager<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For those who want to enter orders exactly according to the set rules even in the MetaTrader application and do not want to use various formulas or calculators for calculations, at FTMO we had created the\u00a0<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/en\/quick-trade-manager\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Quick Trade Manager<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0application.
