For me, with a proven edge and proper risk management everything is achievable, especially when companies nowadays get rid of the time period. It was really pressuring. I passed Phase 1 for 1 month, but it was really chill, not thinking about the time and whether the challenge was about to be failed, because of time.

Even if you have a simple trading strategy. One of the most important aspects in trading is to have proper risk management. Without it, even with the best trading strategy can easily falter and cause the strategy to lose and lose your challenge.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Where have you learned about FTMO?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I have learned about FTMO from the website. When I started searching for growing a trading account by using a small capital.
