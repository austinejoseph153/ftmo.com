Anyone who says it does not is lying or is simply inhuman. My risk management plan helps mitigation of the risks of emotion in a trade.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How does your risk management plan look like?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I use technical support and resistance to select entries, exits, stop loss, and position size. I use fundamental analysis to choose my trades and weigh the risk.<\/p>\n<p>This also plays into my position sizing. I typically will not risk more than 1.5% of equity on any particular trade unless my fundamental outlook will go up to 3% and no more.<\/p>\n<p>As for psychology, I have a set of rules to help against the negative impacts of emotion in trading<\/p>\n<p>1. Always set a stop loss and never move it.<\/p>\n<p>2. Always set a take profit for at least 1\/2 position size.<\/p>\n<p>3. Never risk more than 5% of the equity at any given time.<\/p>\n<p>4. Stick to what I know, the fundamentals. If a trade or hypothesis goes against me I will stop all trading till I figure out why.<\/p>\n<p>5. Never flip position (short\/long) without a strong fundamental reason<\/p>\n<p>6. If loss of equity hits 5% in one day, close all trades and reevaluate. Do not take any more trades till a fundamental understanding is met and do not make any trades till the next trading day.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/KyleM.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-415665\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/KyleM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"824\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>Do you plan to take another FTMO Challenge to manage even bigger capital?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Yes, I will be doing another challenge for another $200k in capital<\/p>\n<p><strong>What was more difficult than expected during your FTMO Challenge or Verification?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Fighting the urge to over-trade<\/p>\n<p><strong>How did Maximum loss limits affect your trading style?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Very well!

This time I did some testing with a slightly different setup which worked as well.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What was more difficult than expected during your FTMO Challenge or Verification?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Verification. The market went more volatile and my setup was more focused on trading the trends. Not ranging volatile market. But with good risk management, I managed to work out a &#8220;ranging market setup&#8221; for myself. Now I like it even more than trading with the trend \ud83d\ude00<\/p>\n<p><strong>What was the hardest obstacle on your trading journey<\/strong>?<\/p>\n<p>For me, the hardest part is always &#8211; letting the good trades run. Tend to take profit\/partials too early. Working on it :). Need to trade more in &#8220;shoot and run&#8221; style.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How did Maximum loss limits affect your trading style?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The maximum loss did not affect me at all. Good risk management, setup trades only and controlled emotions. Daily loss is the affecting factor.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/StenM.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-415678\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/StenM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"824\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>Do you have a trading plan in place, and do you follow it strictly?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Yes, but I like to keep evolving. So I follow it strictly but after backtesting new ideas I might try them with a live account. Mostly system itself is the same. Some confirmation details might change during time etc.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What is the number one piece of advice you would give to a new trader?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Mess around in demo only as long as u have some basic fundamental knowledge. BUT I truly think trading with demo otherwise is wasted time. U GOT TO GET IN THERE and start trading with money.<\/p>\n<p>U have to kill your emotional side. U have to be numb like a fish. And that only happens after getting hurt a couple of times. Second &#8211; RISK MANAGEMENT. Yeah, some guys here get the challenge done in 1 day. To me that only show they can blow up fast too. Third &#8211; Effort &amp; Focus. Study, test, trade, sacrifice other things for learning and trading. Fourth- DISCIPLINE. When u finally nail all those things down, STICK TO IT AND ACTUALLY DO THOSE THINGS. That would be my advice to anyone who just started trading.<\/p>\n<h3>Trader Etienne &#8211; <em>&#8220;Take your time and don&#8217;t overthink.&#8221;<\/em><\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/etiennep.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-415684\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/etiennep.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"412\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>What do you think is the key for long term success in trading?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Discipline, emotions control and consistency.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How did you manage your emotions when you were in a losing trade?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>When you accept a losing trade as a part of the process there&#8217;s no need to worry about any emotions.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Has your psychology ever affected your trading plan?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Yes sometimes, I&#8217;m not perfect but it happens way less than before.
