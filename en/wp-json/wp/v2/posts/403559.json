We will explore that in this article.<\/em><\/p>\n<h2>Risk-on vs Risk-off<\/h2>\n<p>Risk-on and Risk-off are market sentiments where traders and investors are either taking or not taking a risk in the financial markets.<\/p>\n<p>You will often hear in the news that we are in risk-on or risk-off market conditions.<\/p>\n<p>Understanding what this means can help you in your trading and choosing the right instruments to trade.<\/p>\n<h3>Risk-on<\/h3>\n<p>When markets are in a risk-on environment, market participants feel optimistic about the economy so they tend to incline towards riskier assets.<\/p>\n<p>These are stocks, high-yielding bonds or commodity currencies like AUD, NZD, CAD from majors or NOK, ZAR, TRY from exotics.<\/p>\n<p>In commodities, risk-on instruments are Crude Oil or Copper.<\/p>\n<h3>Risk-off<\/h3>\n<p>When market participants are pessimistic about the economy or they expect some uncertainty with a negative impact on the market, they shift from risky assets towards so-called\u00a0safe-havens.<\/p>\n<p>Typical risk-off assets are U.S. Treasury bonds or German Bunds.<\/p>\n<p>For forex traders, these are the JPY and CHF which often rally during the risk-off sentiment as traders are unwinding carry trades.<\/p>\n<p>Carry trade means borrowing a safe-haven asset at a low-interest rate and then buying a high-yielding (riskier) asset in other markets.<\/p>\n<p>Why are Japanese yen and Swiss franc considered safe-haven currencies?<\/p>\n<p>Because they are from countries that own a large amount of foreign currency assets so they can sell those assets and bring to reduce risk.<\/p>\n<p>U.S Dollar is also considered a safe-haven asset.<\/p>\n<p>Especially during risk-off sentiment, traders exit their stock and other risky positions back to the U.S. Dollar.<\/p>\n<p>In a commodity market, Gold is considered to be a safe-haven asset.<\/p>\n<p>Here is the recap of instruments and directions you should be choosing during different environments.<\/p>\n<h3>Trading during a Risk-on sentiment<\/h3>\n<p><strong>Long<\/strong>\u00a0\u2013 Stocks, Commodity Currencies (AUD, NZD, CAD), Exotics, Crude Oil<\/p>\n<p><strong>Short<\/strong>\u00a0\u2013 Bonds, U.S. Dollar, Yen, Swiss Franc<\/p>\n<h3>Trading during a Risk-off sentiment<\/h3>\n<p><strong>Long<\/strong>\u00a0\u2013 U.S. Bonds, German Bunds, U.S. Dollar, Yen, Swiss Franc, Gold<\/p>\n<p><strong>Short<\/strong>\u00a0\u2013 Stocks, Commodities, Non-commodity Currencies<\/p>\n<h3>Predicting the Risk-on and Risk-off<\/h3>\n<p>Some of the great charts to predict risk appetite are\u00a0VIX\u00a0and\u00a0Dollar Index.<\/p>\n<p>VIX is tracking the performance of the S&amp;P 500 which is the most popular equity index.<\/p>\n<p>VIX has a negative correlation with the S&amp;P 500, which means if VIX is up, S&amp;P500 is down.<\/p>\n<p>This means that when VIX is UP, we look for risk-off sentiment in the market and vice versa.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><a class=\"lightbox-added aligncenter\" href=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Screenshot-2021-04-07-at-15.01.12.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\"

are looking for risk-off sentiment, when the Dollar is going down, we are looking for the risk-on sentiment.<\/p>\n<p>This is simply because all stocks and other risky instruments are cashed out back
