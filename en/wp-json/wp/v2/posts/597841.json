I also know and keep telling myself when I&#8217;m in a losing trade that I did everything right, that was my point to entry and that what my strategy &#8220;said&#8221;.

Of course you have to learn a lot of things &#8220;in the game&#8221;, I mean the strategies, then you have to learn what is happening and why is this happening and these type of things. But all in all I think there is <a href=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/en\/the-most-important-trading-skills-for-a-successful-trader\/\">not a single key<\/a> to success in trading, because you have to learn so many things and so many keys for long term success in trading but what I mentioned in the beginning these things the keys for success for me.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What was easier than expected during the FTMO Challenge or Verification?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I expected the criteria to be harder and harder to meet.

Practice was key. I do believe that one of the biggest lessons I learned is to be grateful for everything I learn when I lose a trade. We will progress faster if our emotions remain positive, but I&#8217;m still working on that. Also, creating the right risk management strategy helps you to know that even when you have a loss, your strategy (and with God&#8217;s help) you are more likely to have higher profits and continue to move forward. Know that you will be patient and wait until you have all the confirmations for the next trade.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What was more difficult than expected during your FTMO Challenge or Verification?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Honestly, I&#8217;m grateful for how well things went during the Challenge. I did have an initial downswing during the beginning phase, which got me nervous, but overall, things went very well. I&#8217;m grateful for that. The most difficult thing leading up to being able to take the Challenge was creating a good risk-management strategy, staying patient and waiting for the right time to enter the trades.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Describe your best trade.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>One of the best trades I had was the one that I took when I passed the first phase of the Challenge. It was based off Fibonacci and the market was trending and went to where I expected. Those are generally my best trades and they usually happen after waiting through the consolidation phase, which is the most tricky and very tempting to trade, but when the consolidation phase ends, there is often a pretty clear path for me on where the market will go. That was the case with this trade.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-597935\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Daniel-trades.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"908\" height=\"1231\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Daniel-trades.png 908w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Daniel-trades-221x300.png 221w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Daniel-trades-760x1030.png 760w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Daniel-trades-768x1041.png 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Daniel-trades-520x705.png 520w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 908px) 100vw, 908px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>How did loss limits affect your trading style?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I really do appreciate the <a href=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/en\/watch-out-for-open-losses\/\">maximum loss limits<\/a>. They actually helped me to create a solid risk management strategy. My first goal is to get profitable and stay profitable. I want to be far away from the overall maximum loss. As for the daily loss, I have determined that if I ever lose more than $5,000 in a day, I have to stop. That means that my profitable days are at least $10,000. So not only do I have risk management on my individual trades, but I also have a daily risk management strategy. It has helped a lot because when you&#8217;re struggling enough to lose $5,000 (based off of a $200,000 account) you&#8217;re most likely not understanding the market the way you thought you were and it&#8217;s good to take a break. There is one very important thing I would recommend, and that is to base the daily loss off of the total account balance of the previous day, and not off of the initial account balance. This would allow me to scale my account the way that I would like to, based off of my risk-management strategy.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How would you rate your experience with FTMO?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>5 Stars. I truly appreciate being able to take as many practice tests as I needed to in order to feel comfortable enough to take the real trial. That helped a ton. Customer service has also been great. The way you have adapted and changed the rules according to what makes the most sense has been great as well. I only have 1 strong recommendation and that is to make the daily maximum limit based on the total account size of the previous day, and not on the initial account size.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/trader.ftmo.com\/start-challenge?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=banner&amp;utm_campaign=tradersqa\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-546404 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_1-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"130\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_1-1.png 800w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_1-1-300x49.png 300w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_1-1-768x125.png 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_1-1-705x115.png 705w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_1-1-24x4.png 24w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_1-1-36x6.png 36w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_1-1-48x8.png 48w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>One piece of advice for people starting the FTMO Challenge now.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I would only take the real Challenge after having taken the Free Trials enough to feel comfortable.

Being locked in means that based on all of my indicators, I truly feel where the market is going and taking the trade at the right time. Basically, instead of fear of loss and greed, it&#8217;s based off faith and knowledge&#8230; A feeling of calmness. It&#8217;s the same type of emotion as when I&#8217;m driving a car&#8230; I calmly watch the road and take the turns at the time I need to, doing my best to stay safe as I go.
