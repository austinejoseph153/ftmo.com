I would always worry about not having enough time for the challenge and rushing it. However, I realize that there is no rush and you have to let the market tell you what it wants to do. I would sometimes want to force trades but had to stop and take my emotions out of the picture and realize that I may need to wait another hour or so and be sure that before I take the trade that all my criteria&#8217;s are met.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Do you plan to take another FTMO Challenge to manage even bigger capital?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I do plan on taking another challenge but not soon. Maybe a few months down the line once I get in the groove of how this fires funded account feels.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How does your risk management plan look like?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>My risk management is very strict. I typically will have a 5-8 pip stop loss which sounds like very little wiggle room. Trust me my stops do get hit and sometimes end up going in my desired direction after being hit but that&#8217;s all part of having good risk management. However, when my trades do play out I will typically make between 20-36 pips which covers multiple losses. This is the key in my opinion when it comes to trading.<\/p>\n<p><strong>One piece of advice for people starting the FTMO Challenge now.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Keep your mind on the end goal.

The worst you can do is doubt yourself and when you don&#8217;t have faith in yourself, you start to fail. So it&#8217;s important to know about the emotional and psychological part of trading. Having an effective trading strategy is just a small piece of the big puzzle. Balance the emotions and be aware of your mental process are important in the forex market. After a few losses, it&#8217;s likely to doubt your trading style, but it&#8217;s better to look at your mistakes and learn from them. Let these mistakes adjust your trading strategy a little bit. Also, I learned a lot through having the market experience.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How did Maximum loss limits affect your trading style?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Maximum loss limits learned me to have safe, consistent, and disciplined risk management. It helped me a lot to look at the trades I took with the right risk-reward ratio, 1:3. Also, I have a trading plan in which I only set 1 % risk a day. I learned also to not overtrade and to not be greedy, I wanted to keep it simple and organized during the Challenge. This is done by being organized and having a trading plan.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-407981\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Screenshot-2021-07-13-at-9.50.24.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"812\" height=\"975\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>What was more difficult than expected during your FTMO Challenge or Verification?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It was difficult when you had bad losses during the Challenge, but the key to passing the Challenge is to stay disciplined and to take a few, simple trades that have nice profits.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What inspires you to pursue trading?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Freedom that you will get, to be able to travel everywhere you want while you can trade and to be a confident &amp; an independent woman.

Make sure you have your trading plan, and to have the right, safe, tight risk management. The most important thing to know is to trust yourself and don&#8217;t doubt about your trading style. Keep it simple and don&#8217;t let the emotions take your Challenge over. You don&#8217;t need to trade every day, some profitable days per week are enough.
