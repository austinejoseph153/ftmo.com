I thought I was a good trader just because I understood the charts and technical analysis, but I was wrong. The last piece of the puzzle for me was mastering my own thoughts and emotions. Once I learned how to control my emotions and get out of my own way, I became much more successful and profitable.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What was easier than expected during the FTMO Challenge or Verification?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The challenge portion was much harder than the verification stage.

You have 30 days. Ensure you have the capability to be profitable before putting money up for the challenge by working with the free trial\/demo account first. Think about your account in percentages. That will help you risk accordingly as well as pass the challenge within the allotted time frame.<\/p>\n<p>__________<\/p>\n<div class=\"entry-content\">\n<div class=\"entry-content\">\n<p><em>Editorial note<\/em>:\u00a0<em>All responses are 100% organic and received from our new FTMO Traders during the contract signing process.
