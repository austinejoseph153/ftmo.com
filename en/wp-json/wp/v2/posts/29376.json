His last trade has even hit the desired <a href=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/en\/#profit-target\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Profit Target<\/a>. We might say that this trader observes the trend following a system where he awaits break-outs. These trading strategies have something in common. They often have smaller losses, but then the potential profits are really high. If we were not following the open losses, we could consider this <a href=\"https:\/\/trader.ftmo.com\/start-challenge\">FTMO<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/trader.ftmo.com\/start-challenge\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Challenge<\/a> being passed and the trader would normally advance into Verification stage.<\/p>\n<p>However, if we look into the open losses, we observe an interesting phenomenon. This trader actually had <strong>92,6% of his account in the floating losses<\/strong>, probably hoping that the market conditions could reverse his losses one day. Or not\u2026 His total open loss was -\u20ac18,524.11 on \u20ac20,000 <a href=\"https:\/\/trader.ftmo.com\/start-challenge\">FTMO<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/trader.ftmo.com\/start-challenge\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Challenge<\/a>. In one moment, the trader\u2019s Equity was as low as \u20ac1,475.89, down from the initial \u20ac20,000 .<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/imagemetrix-1-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-412446\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/imagemetrix-1-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"818\" height=\"775\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>We often experience beginner traders complaining with the argument that the market conditions will eventually change and so why is their FTMO Challenge marked as violated? In other words, if a trader doesn\u2019t have a proper control of his account Equity and risks taken, he\/she probably does not have enough discipline to consider trading a serious business. We hope this short article clearly explains that no serious investor ever observes the Balance curve that displays the closed trades only, but the current assets in a form of Equity curve.<\/p>\n<p>For the above reasons, investors also don\u2019t accept MetaTrader statements, myFXbook statements or other external sources that don\u2019t prove the progress of the Equity curve and the reliability isn\u2019t always assured.<\/p>\n<p>At <a href=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/welcome\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">FTMO<\/a>, we understand that market conditions might vary and that\u2019s why we offer our traders a generous <strong>10% drawdown<\/strong> buffer and <strong>5% max daily loss<\/strong>. These conditions are in a ratio of 1:1 (loss to profit) and this is probably the best prop trading environment out there. Our major aim is that our traders are experienced and that\u2019s also why we introduced the above risk parameters that should keep traders in a game.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In the following example, we will look at why it\u2019s so important for investors to monitor the open losses, why the equity curve is more important for traders than the balance curve and why they should not take into account MetaTrader statements, myFXbook statements or other external sources.
