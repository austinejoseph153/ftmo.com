I&#8217;ve been day trading for a year now, and I&#8217;ve been following charts since 2017. I&#8217;ve developed my own trading strategy. I analyze potential price movements, considering all possibilities, and interpret them myself. To avoid being influenced by anyone&#8217;s ideas or charts, I don&#8217;t follow anyone.

Now that I&#8217;ve reached a 200k account, my advice is don&#8217;t give up.
