I look forward to a great time with FTMO.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Describe your best trade.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I regard myself as intra-day trader. I love a trending markets, obviously. I use the 1-Day timeframe to mark out zones for TP or reversal points. I used the 4H and 1H to know the current trend of the market. I make sure my trades are in line with the trend. My best trade is when all my confluences align: demand or supply zone, liquidity sweep, price on 200EMA or 50EMA, daily Pivot level. On the lower time frame: change of character.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What does your risk management plan look like?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I focus more on New York session. My standard risk is 1%. However, if all my confluences all align, I can push it up above 1%, but less than 2%. If I find a setup, however in London session, I risk 0.5%. If all my confluences align, I can push it above 0.5% but not more than 1%. This risk management structure is because I see London as more volatile and less liquid and New York less volatile and more liquid. I only trade XAUUSD.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-599571\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Samuel-trades.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"911\" height=\"1233\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Samuel-trades.png 911w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Samuel-trades-222x300.png 222w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Samuel-trades-761x1030.png 761w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Samuel-trades-768x1039.png 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Samuel-trades-521x705.png 521w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 911px) 100vw, 911px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>What was more difficult than expected during your FTMO Challenge or Verification?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I started the challenge well by making 2% profit. However, for whatever reason my SL of about 1% was not respected, so I lost about 3.5% on the trade, taking me to drawdown. This messed up with my psychology. I struggled to bring quickly break even, I went down further, till like -8%. I advised myself to focus on trading like a professional and not just passing the Challenge. I was able to bring it back up to break even, then from there it was easier to keep pushing it up and up, not without losses though. Verification was easier because I had built confidence from passing the Challenge and the experience gathered along the way.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How did you manage your emotions while you were in a losing trade?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Trading in the Zone is a book that helped me a lot.

I realize I do not need 100% rate to be profitable, but a SOLID risk management and good trading edge so when losses came, I took it as part of the journey, resisting the temptation of revenge trading or over-leveraging.
