You make an amazing plan, but it just will not go exactly like that. I overcame this part by taking profits earlier and securing my profits. I also made use of a trailing stop on some occasions so that the profits could be maximized.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What was easier than expected during the FTMO Challenge or Verification?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I expected the Challenge to go way longer, I failed 3 accounts before. I took 2 months off to become stable again, and set up a plan so that I would have excellent risk management. In the end, I managed to finish both Challenges in 6 trading days, 2 days quicker than the minimum. So I had to trade 2 days extra. \ud83d\ude42<\/p>\n<p><strong>Where have you learned about FTMO?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I learned about FTMO because of a friend, he introduced me to it and showed me the basics of Forex trading, from there on a group was created and we learned more and more every day.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-590242\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/Marcel-trades.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"908\" height=\"1306\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/Marcel-trades.png 908w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/Marcel-trades-209x300.png 209w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/Marcel-trades-716x1030.png 716w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/Marcel-trades-768x1105.png 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/Marcel-trades-490x705.png 490w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 908px) 100vw, 908px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>How did loss limits affect your trading style?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Maximum loss did not affect my trading style, as I said risk management is my top priority, I try to not overtrade and keep losses reasonable.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How did you manage your emotions when you were in a losing trade?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I managed my emotions by just accepting it. A loss won\u2019t be a problem for me since I made use of good risk management, so a loss did not affect me that much. So, no revenge trading etc. Accept your losses &#8211; it is part of the process.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What would you like to say to other traders who are attempting an FTMO Challenge?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>For other traders I would say, risk management and emotional control is the most important step in trading. Learn to master these 2 aspects and you will be profitable already. Don\u2019t overtrade yourself, and don\u2019t be shy to look for help. FTMO has some amazing informative videos and an Academy program I am trying to finish now. There are a lot of sources to learn, feel free to test several and find what you like. And 1 more tip: don&#8217;t trade news events if you don&#8217;t exactly know what you are doing. Also, try out different trading platforms like Metatrader or cTrader so you find the software you feel comfortable with. I personally use cTrader \ud83d\ude42<\/p>\n<h3>Trader Justin: \u201cWhatever risk you think is acceptable, cut it in half and aim for one A+ trade setup each week.\u201d<\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-590217\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/Justin-210x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"210\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/Justin-210x300.jpg 210w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/Justin-720x1030.jpg 720w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/Justin-768x1098.jpg 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/Justin-1074x1536.jpg 1074w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/Justin-1432x2048.jpg 1432w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/Justin-1049x1500.jpg 1049w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/Justin-493x705.jpg 493w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/Justin-scaled.jpg 1790w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 210px) 100vw, 210px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>What do you think is the most important characteristic\/attribute to become a profitable trader?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll give you three. 1) Discipline 2) Patience 3) Lack of loyalty. You must create rules for yourself and have the discipline to follow them. Otherwise, you&#8217;ll have no idea why you&#8217;re losing trades, or winning for that matter. Patience is a must in this business. It only takes one good trade each week to grow an account. The issue is that most traders treat their account like a slot machine, attempting to feed it every day regardless of market conditions. You need to have patience to wait for the A+ setups and patience once in the trade to let your winners run. A lack of loyalty seems like a strange (positive) attribute for a trader, but it&#8217;s essential. You have to be able to flip your bias in an instant if the market proves you wrong. Otherwise, you&#8217;ll quickly find yourself trading what you want to happen instead of trading what the charts are telling you. I could go on but those three are essential for any aspiring trader.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/trader.ftmo.com\/start-challenge?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=banner&amp;utm_campaign=tradersqa\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-546397 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_2-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"130\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_2-1.png 800w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_2-1-300x49.png 300w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_2-1-768x125.png 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_2-1-705x115.png 705w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_2-1-24x4.png 24w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_2-1-36x6.png 36w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_2-1-48x8.png 48w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>Describe your best trade.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>My best trade was the GBPJPY weekly head and shoulders that formed just before the 2008 financial crisis.

The problem began when I was informed my phase 2 Verification would NOT be transitioned to unlimited time. This caused me more heartache and stress than almost anything I&#8217;ve experienced. I overcame this by eventually having an epiphany. I simply prayed to God and said I do not want to be afraid anymore. I do not want to be ruled by fear, anxiety, stress, or doubt. I&#8217;m going to trade with confidence and just trust in you, the Lord God.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What was more difficult than expected during your FTMO Challenge or Verification?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I will reiterate again. The time limit caused me inconceivable amounts of stress and anxiety. I had a game plan. I had a perfect trading strategy, but the added pressure was seeping deep into my subconscious. I was making decisions that I would never do in a normal situation.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/trader.ftmo.com\/start-challenge?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=banner&amp;utm_campaign=tradersqa\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-546404 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_1-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"130\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_1-1.png 800w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_1-1-300x49.png 300w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_1-1-768x125.png 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_1-1-705x115.png 705w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_1-1-24x4.png 24w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_1-1-36x6.png 36w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_1-1-48x8.png 48w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>Do you plan to take another FTMO Challenge to manage even bigger capital?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I am already on another FTMO Challenge.

We cannot control the markets or the outcome, but we can control our emotions, risk management, trade management and decision-making.
