Once the trade is officially a loss (+\/- 1% of account) it is important to remind yourself everything is executed according to the trading plan.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Do you have a trading plan in place, and do you follow it strictly?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Trading consistently without a trading plan is practically impossible, so yes, a plan is in place! Over the years there have been plenty of occasions when I violated my own plan. Reasons for that always go back to psychology. Greed, FOMO, impatience, revenge, etc. etc. the list goes on and on. FTMO helped me to make that last step with strict drawdown limits.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How does your risk management plan look like?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>0.83% risk per trade. Max 2 losing trades a day, max 4 losing trades first week, 3 second week. When 7 losing trades below initial capital no trading for a week. Next trading weeks cannot exceed 3 losing trades. This provides a time span of at least 5 weeks before hitting the 10% max loss limit and avoids emotional trading.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-529955\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/Alfred-trades.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"913\" height=\"1164\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/Alfred-trades.png 913w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/Alfred-trades-235x300.png 235w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/Alfred-trades-808x1030.png 808w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/Alfred-trades-768x979.png 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/Alfred-trades-553x705.png 553w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/Alfred-trades-19x24.png 19w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/Alfred-trades-28x36.png 28w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/Alfred-trades-38x48.png 38w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 913px) 100vw, 913px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>What do you think is the most important characteristic\/attribute to become a profitable trader?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Stick to your plan.
