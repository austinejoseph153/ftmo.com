If trading is our true passion however, it will be much easier to overcome losses and it&#8217;ll be easier to follow basic rules.

Trading helps me to use this skillset to analyze market data. I also believe that trading will allow me the personal freedom to reclaim my time and spend more of it with my family.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Has your psychology ever affected your trading plan?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Of course. When trades don&#8217;t go your way, it&#8217;s easy to get attached to the disappointment and as a result, you find yourself revenge trading. I always access my mood and energy level prior to trading because a tired or grumpy trader will take shortcuts or not be in the mental space to make the best trading decisions which could ultimately harm your outcome.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What would you like to say to other traders that are attempting to pass FTMO Challenge?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>If you have the experience, the discipline and can manage risk, then I say go for it! It is said that Trading is 90% mental and 10% skill. Learn the fundamentals of technical analysis for the market. Manage your emotions and greed and develop a trading plan and a set of rules, and you can be well on your way to joining the FTMO family such as me.<\/p>\n<h3>Trader Roderick: \u201cSet the trade and go on with your life for the day.\u201d<\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-428751\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Roderick-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Roderick-225x300.jpg 225w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Roderick-773x1030.jpg 773w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Roderick-768x1024.jpg 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Roderick-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Roderick-1536x2048.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Roderick-1125x1500.jpg 1125w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Roderick-529x705.jpg 529w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Roderick-18x24.jpg 18w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Roderick-27x36.jpg 27w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Roderick-36x48.jpg 36w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Roderick-scaled.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>What do you think is the key to long-term success in trading?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I believe the key to long term success in trading is risk management, following your rules, and controlling your emotions.

I am really looking forward to retiring from sailing this year.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What would you like to say to other traders that are attempting to pass FTMO Challenge?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>My first advice to other traders is to accept that forex trading is another profession. We need both the theoretical and practical competencies to be a PRO in forex trading. If they will just take their time to acquire skills and experiences in trading, eventually they will become profitable in trading. Heavily invest in their training and education to be successful in forex trading. Good thing is that they can now access many information\/webinars\/YouTube presentations online for free. Just need to refine it and develop their own trading strategy. Most importantly is to develop a solid trading psychology. I learned in the past that successful trading formula is 70% psychology, 20% money management and 10% strategy. But through experience, I believe that psychology is more than 90%. What I mean with solid trading psychology is that a trader should be able to isolate his thoughts and focus only trading during the trading hours. For example, a medical doctor during surgical operation, he\/she is not thinking of other things during this period but only about the operation. Same with trading, one trader should be able to think only his trading plan, strategy, set up, etc. during the trading hours. This is not easy, but it is doable. Good luck in passing the challenge and verification!<\/p>\n<h3>Trader Claire: \u201cI don\u2019t think that luck can be eliminated.\u201d<\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-428763\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Claire-230x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"230\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Claire-230x300.jpg 230w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Claire-18x24.jpg 18w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Claire-28x36.jpg 28w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Claire-37x48.jpg 37w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Claire.jpg 245w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 230px) 100vw, 230px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Do you have a trading plan in place, and do you follow it strictly?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I try to stick to my trading plan as much as possible. Whilst discipline is essential, I also think that it is important to have a little flexibility and discretion when trading.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What does your risk management plan look like?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I typically risk around 1% of my account balance on any one trade and I always use a stop loss. I only trade once or twice per day to avoid overtrading. I don\u2019t trade if there is a major economic news event. I will not trade if I am feeling unwell or emotional.

On this occasion, I was able to actively manage the trade over the course of several hours. Sometimes, my work commitments do not allow for this, so I usually must accept a low risk to reward ratio and must always set a take profit. However, on this occasion I was available to manage the trade and I trailed my stop loss for a fantastic result.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How did you eliminate the factor of luck in your trading?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I don\u2019t think that luck can be eliminated. You can only be honest with yourself and acknowledge good\/bad luck as it happens. In my opinion, a good trading plan should put a trader in the best position to take advantage of luck, by minimizing losses and maximizing gains.<\/p>\n<p><strong>One piece of advice for people starting FTMO Challenge now.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Use the free trial.
