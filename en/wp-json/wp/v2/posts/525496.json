This I achieve through quantifying quantities of demand and supply at price levels. I am capable of identifying reliable price turning points. As another means of proof checking high probabilities on the trades I open, I use harmonic patterns, which indeed also add value to my trade performance.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How did you manage your emotions when you were in a losing trade?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I simply managed emotions by ensuring that I stick to the rules that I have defined for my trading recipe or plan. I also ensured that by trading during high volatility session. Last, I avoided to manage multiple pairs or running trades, rather I would trade one pair, but open multiple trades for one sure shot trade. Again, I seldom run trades for lengthy periods. This helps me to have a very minimal loses whenever I may come across it.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What was the most difficult during your FTMO Challenge or Verification and how did you overcome it?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I felt too pressured when wanting to reach the set profit target in a record time.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-525538\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Lebohang-trades.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"910\" height=\"1256\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Lebohang-trades.png 910w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Lebohang-trades-217x300.png 217w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Lebohang-trades-746x1030.png 746w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Lebohang-trades-768x1060.png 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Lebohang-trades-511x705.png 511w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Lebohang-trades-17x24.png 17w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Lebohang-trades-26x36.png 26w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Lebohang-trades-35x48.png 35w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 910px) 100vw, 910px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>What does your risk management plan look like?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Most importantly, three most significant practices that are building blocks to my risk management are, I use proper protective stop loss, proper position size and keep losses very small. In my experience, Forex is not a 100% sure shot practice from which I know for certainty that the next opened trade is a win! But in my practice, I deploy 1:3 risk to reward ratio in positions I open. This helps me to ensure that even if I lose four consecutive trades, if I win one, it covers all losses, with a positive profit.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What was more difficult than expected during your FTMO Challenge or Verification?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The most difficult practice was this of working on targeted profit value. Regardless how of how much equity I had and how little the expected profit I had to put was, it was very challenging to me. The thing was, being in that situation somehow disoriented my trading psychology, this hardship was worse especially in the first challenge. In the second challenge, I had to review my performance, and had to just calm, and restored my normal performance. In the first challenge again, I did not understand this part of minimum daily loss, which nearly made me fail the challenge, but consistent live chats I had with support made me aware and I changed my approach instantly.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What is the number one piece of advice you would give to a new trader?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Most importantly, for a new trader that is good in trading, I just have a strongest believe the big challenge to them at times is not understanding the expectations of FTMO. For instance, this actually happened to me, when I had a different view on what it is meant by a minimum daily loss. This nearly made me loose the challenge, but for the fact that I kept having several live chats with support, I was luckily saved from fail as for most rules, I misinterpreted them, but they saved me!!! The new traders must ensure that, they have live chats with the support, for those rules that determine their success in the challenges. My experience, one day I made a minimum daily loss of $465 approximately, and this huge loss, I was not aware that, if it hits $500.1 for instance, I lost the challenge.<\/p>\n<h3>Trader Luke: To grow and develop, you must be willing to learn from past mistakes.<\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-525511\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Luke-169x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"169\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Luke-169x300.jpg 169w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Luke-579x1030.jpg 579w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Luke-768x1366.jpg 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Luke-864x1536.jpg 864w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Luke-1152x2048.jpg 1152w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Luke-843x1500.jpg 843w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Luke-396x705.jpg 396w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Luke-13x24.jpg 13w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Luke-20x36.jpg 20w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Luke-27x48.jpg 27w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Luke-scaled.jpg 1439w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 169px) 100vw, 169px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>What inspires you to pursue trading?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Trading allows me to become the best version of myself. In order to grow and develop, you must be willing to learn from past mistakes and I apply that to both my trading and my personal life.

The strategies I learnt were full of discretion and didn\u2019t have clear entries or position management rules. Once I found a more systematic approach and heavily backtested it, I found I was able to apply my edge consistently with almost no discretion.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How would you rate your experience with FTMO?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>FTMO is an amazing platform for profitable traders to raise funds. The 10% drawdown and 5% daily loss limits allow you to have flexibility to apply a winning strategy.

I decided to step away from the charts for a few days to hit the reset button.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What do you think is the key to long-term success in trading?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>For me, the key to long term success in trading is to approach it with scale in mind.

At the end it was a bit rough because I didn&#8217;t trade at specifically hours I usually trade because I was in Austria for another business. But at the end I have acknowledged my mistakes and corrected them.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What does your risk management plan look like?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>My risk management is usually to risk 1-3% via whole day.

I risk between 0.25 to 2.50 % and no more whatsoever. 99 percent of my trades are placed within 0.25 to 1% risk of capital. If I am above 10% profit for that month and an excellent setup come along with technical and fundamentals aligned, I will place a 1% trade and scale it to 2.5% risk max, but I must say these are rare. I would like to point out, 2.5% risk trades are swing trades and my stops are wide, I don\u2019t place a day trade with high risk as a small slippage can make thing really bad really quick.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Do you plan to take another FTMO Challenge to manage even bigger capital?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Yes, I am aiming for max allocation. I have come to realize bigger capital gives you the flexibly and patience to wait for the right trade. Only a few trades with minimum risk can give you handsome returns.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How would you rate your experience with FTMO?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>My experience has been awesome. US500 had a spike in my evaluation trading, and it gave me 400K profit, however I want to say I place a lotto trade, this was a data error, I notified them, and they investigated and corrected the error.
