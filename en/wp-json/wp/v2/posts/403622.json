It has been reported that more than 60% of millennials are affected by the fear of missing out in some aspect of their lives. We live in a modern age of social media, which gives us unprecedented access to the lives of others. Thus it is only human nature to fear that we are missing out on something.<\/p>\n<p>FOMO in trading is the\u00a0<i>fear of missing out<\/i>\u00a0on big opportunities in the market, and it is not a rare phenomenon. It doesn\u2019t really matter if you are a beginner or a professional trader, FOMO can affect everyone and anyone.<\/p>\n<p>This fear stems from the feeling that other traders are more successful, and it can cause overly high expectations, a lack of long-term perspective, lack of patience and overconfidence\/not enough confidence.<\/p>\n<p>The FOMO trader tends to enter trades without enough thought, or closing trades at bad moments because it\u2019s what others seem to be doing. There is that need to follow the herd with a lack of research or lack of self-confidence. FOMO is an internal feeling, but one that can be impacted by a range of external factors.<\/p>\n<p>Some of the external factors that could lead to a trader experiencing FOMO are:<\/p>\n<p><strong>Volatile markets.<\/strong> Of course, when there is market movement in any direction \u2013 it can make us think about missing out on a great opportunity, right?<\/p>\n<p><strong>Big winning streaks.<\/strong> Winning streaks don\u2019t last forever \u2013 stay humble.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Repetitive losses.<\/strong>\u00a0Traders can end up in a vicious cycle; entering a position, getting scared, closing out, then re-entering another trade as anxiety and disappointment arise about not holding out. This can eventually lead to bigger losses.<\/p>\n<p><strong>News, rumours and social media.<\/strong> Be cautious as to who and what you will let influence your thought process and what you already know. Don\u2019t take social media content at face value. Take your time, do your research, and evaluate every single piece of information.<\/p>\n<h2>So what are the main differences between FOMO trading and disciplined trading?<\/h2>\n<p>Disciplined traders have a plan, do the necessary research and analysis, set a comfortable risk-to-reward ratio, use sensible stop-loss and take-profit levels. They follow a plan, keep a log, and achieve their trading goals.<\/p>\n<p>And FOMO traders? They react compulsively, jump on trends, take opinion as fact, and follow rumours. Then they consider the upside and maximize exposure. They get into an uncomfortable situation because they enter a risky position and then panic, close out and do this again and again because they don\u2019t have a plan, even in the case there is a plan, it is not always followed through. They don\u2019t keep a log and for the above reasons FOMO takes over.<\/p>\n<h2>But can FOMO be overcome?<\/h2>\n<p>One of the essential components when it comes to the prevention of FOMO is greater self-awareness. Be self-aware, know who you are and which strategy suits you the best and fully understand the importance of discipline and risk management in trading.<\/p>\n<p>Concentrate on yourself, on your strategy, do your own research \u2013 you are unique and therefore your path to success is unique. Stay patient and calm. If you see others being successful, take this as an inspiration \u2013 you can be also successful in your own unique way. Don\u2019t follow others, don\u2019t pay too much attention to social media posts, just stay on your own individual path.<\/p>\n<p>If you believe in yourself, if you are self-aware and have a plan, you will be fine. When you have self-knowledge, you\u2019re naturally calm and poised. Stick to your trading plan, do your research and keep a trading journal.<\/p>\n<p>Be patient, disciplined, and confident. If you think you\u2019re unable to overcome FOMO, our FTMO performance coach can help you overcome this fear.<\/p>\n<p>And remember; what comes easy \u2013 won\u2019t last and what lasts \u2013 won\u2019t come easy.<\/p>\n<p>Believe that even if you don\u2019t win today, sooner or later your win will come. Market opportunities will always be here for your next trade. Patience is the key to success.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Are you familiar with FOMO?
