I personally like to take larger positions when I have multiple confluences on a trade, but this rule forces you to size down and really manage the live trade you are in. There are pros and cons to this rule. It forces you to be diligent with your entries and exits, as well as managing risk; but makes it tough to size into positions. I do like how FTMO incorporates your daily profit into your daily drawdown, but I believe your daily drawdown should change depending how much profit you have in the account on a day-to-day basis. This allows you to use your profits to scale into positions. Regardless, I had no trouble trading.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Has your psychology ever affected your trading plan?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Psychology is one of the biggest factors that will determine your success in trading. That is something as traders we must work on every day. It is something I continue to work on and develop every day and it will always be more important to me than technical analysis. Getting your TA down is one thing, but if you cannot implement the psychology behind trading and rules to follow, you will never be profitable.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What was the most difficult during your FTMO Challenge or Verification and how did you overcome it?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The biggest issue I had to overcome was my position size and risk management. Depending on the account you are trading and the forex pair, you must manage your risk accordingly. I had major winners, but some major losses, and I learned that the smaller positions I took, the easier it was for me to cut small losses and hold my winners for a longer duration. Big profits, smaller losses.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-587223 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/Garrett-trades.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"914\" height=\"1330\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/Garrett-trades.png 914w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/Garrett-trades-206x300.png 206w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/Garrett-trades-708x1030.png 708w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/Garrett-trades-768x1118.png 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/Garrett-trades-484x705.png 484w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 914px) 100vw, 914px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>What do you think is the key for long term success in trading?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>1.

I ensure that I stick to my plan risking only 1 % per trade.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What do you think is the key for long term success in trading?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Proper risk management and patience.

I personally believe all jobs are a mix of risk, time requirements, and income received. In standard employment, you have low risk, which in turn requires you to spend large amounts of time and your income will be low. Trading is a profession where your risk is high, but with low time requirements (you don\u2019t have to work many hours if you are consistently profitable, have low costs of living, and trade high volumes) and the income potential is very large. With these principles it is impossible to have a profession with very low risk, low time requirements, and high-income potential, that is a fantasy.
