A profitable trader should not struggle establishing a profitable opportunity. As much as risk is an essential factor, a profitable trader should have a proper risk management skill and a good strategy to enable him profit from the opportunities that present themselves in the market. Patience is key and confidence in his or her abilities is essential. A profitable trader should always be comfortable and hungry for more knowledge which is wise but also while enhancing that knowledge sticking to what works for that particular trader is important and it\u2019s what makes every trader unique.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Where have you learnt about FTMO?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">FTMO is the prop firm to be with for any trader out there that wants to grow.

Making 10% of the account with only being able to lose 10% is kind of hard. It\u2019s not too bad but what I do is, I take less trades than I usually would take so I can find a set up that has an 70% probability in my opinion to play out in my direction. The less sure I am about a trade during the 2 stages of verification, the less likely I will take the trade.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-535964\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Tyree-trades.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"914\" height=\"1221\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Tyree-trades.png 914w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Tyree-trades-225x300.png 225w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Tyree-trades-771x1030.png 771w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Tyree-trades-768x1026.png 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Tyree-trades-528x705.png 528w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Tyree-trades-18x24.png 18w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Tyree-trades-27x36.png 27w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Tyree-trades-36x48.png 36w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 914px) 100vw, 914px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><b>Do you have a trading plan in place, and do you follow it strictly?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes, I have a trading plan. I probably don\u2019t follow it strictly enough because I listen to price action. So, if price is telling me to enter but my plan is telling me to wait, most of the time I wait but sometimes if the set up looks really clean I will take it anyway.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>What was more difficult than expected during your FTMO Challenge or Verification?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nothing was really more difficult than expected but I will say, if you don\u2019t have great risk management, it will take some skill and talent and maybe a little bit of luck in order to come back from your loses.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>What is the number one piece of advice you would give to a new trader?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Follow the trend. Do not trade when price action is consolidating. And most importantly, be patient. Do not force a trade just because you want to rush the process. Also, make sure you do your research and study 10x harder than you did in school. Lots if people don\u2019t become profitable until their 5th years and longer but this is only going on my second year, and I already passed 2 challenges because I stayed up all night and day studying and reading books. I would recommend reading \u201cTrading in the zone\u201d this was the first book I read, and it changed my life.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Trader Eilidh: &#8220;Each trade has been placed for a reason.&#8221;<\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-535887\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Eilidh-243x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"243\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Eilidh-243x300.jpg 243w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Eilidh-833x1030.jpg 833w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Eilidh-768x949.jpg 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Eilidh-570x705.jpg 570w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Eilidh-19x24.jpg 19w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Eilidh-29x36.jpg 29w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Eilidh-39x48.jpg 39w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Eilidh.jpg 919w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 243px) 100vw, 243px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>How did you manage your emotions when you were in a losing trade?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Managing emotions throughout the whole process was hard but definitely expected, I knew that this wouldn&#8217;t be easy, and I wasn&#8217;t wrong. When in losing trades, I just kept reminding myself that it isn&#8217;t over until the trade is closed and that one losing trade means nothing. Each trade has been placed for a reason and reminding myself of this helped. Understanding that it only takes one trade to pull it all back is a must and keeping focus and consistent is important. I knew that I had the ability, it was just putting it into practice under the added pressure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Do you plan to take another FTMO Challenge to manage even bigger capital?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eventually. Personally, I want to focus on one account for now and see how the coming months go. I wouldn&#8217;t want the pressure of another challenge to cause my emotions to spiral putting the new account at risk. I think when I have traded on this account and feel content with the process only then I will attempt a second challenge.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Has your psychology ever affected your trading plan?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of course, but I try too always remind myself of the end goal and enjoy the process. This tends to work and keeps my emotions low.

Personally, I think for me having not placed a trade (including on a demo) until after months of learning helped me get to where I am today. I had read about the % of traders who fail and didn&#8217;t want to be one so knew education was the most important part. Also, if you\u2019re doing the challenge, try keep it to yourself, the added pressure of others asking how it\u2019s going and feeling a need to please them could put you off.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Trader Edward: &#8220;Hardest thing for me has been not to let my trading be governed by my emotions.&#8221;<\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-535894\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Edward-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Edward-225x300.jpg 225w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Edward-773x1030.jpg 773w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Edward-768x1024.jpg 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Edward-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Edward-1536x2048.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Edward-1125x1500.jpg 1125w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Edward-529x705.jpg 529w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Edward-18x24.jpg 18w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Edward-27x36.jpg 27w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Edward-36x48.jpg 36w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Edward-scaled.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>What was the hardest obstacle on your trading journey?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There were a few.
