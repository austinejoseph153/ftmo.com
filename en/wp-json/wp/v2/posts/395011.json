Whether its emotions of fear or greed, it is one of my largest Challenges to silence those emotions and to trust my analysis or capabilities.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Do you have a trading plan in place, and do you follow it strictly?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Yes, I do follow my trading plan strictly. Which involves: trading window hours, confirmations to enter the market, risk management, take profit\/ partial rules.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How does your risk management plan look like?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>My risk management plan is to risk 0.25%-0.5% of my account balance per trade.<\/p>\n<p>The decision of how much to risk is dependent on which trading session I am participating in and how many confirmations my analysis shows me.<\/p>\n<p>My risk\/reward ratio for trades is a minimum of a 1:3 which allows me to confidently achieve weekly 6% gains, which is where I will stop trading for the week unless I have a position running in profit and will bring my stop loss to where it will not allow me to fall below my 6% weekly gain target.<\/p>\n<p>Risk management I believe is the #1 most important element in a successful trader and is the #1 reason most traders fail.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/adamm.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-395030\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/adamm.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"913\" height=\"853\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/adamm.jpg 913w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/adamm-300x280.jpg 300w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/adamm-768x718.jpg 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/adamm-705x659.jpg 705w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 913px) 100vw, 913px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>What inspires you to pursue trading?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I pursue trading because it is my passion and it is something I thoroughly enjoy doing. Aside from it being my passion, it also allows me to make a significant income from anywhere in the world. It allows me to have time and money freedom if used correctly. I also love everything else that trading involves: chart analysis, studying\/ back testing, economics, etc.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How would you rate your experience with FTMO?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>My experience with FTMO has been outstanding. The process is super simple to follow, and I think the opportunity they give traders is incredibly generous.<\/p>\n<p>I also love the business model they have created, I think its great and fair. The customer service has been amazing too, any support emails I have sent have been responded to rapidly with amazing communication. 10\/10 rating overall.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What is the number one advice you would give to a new trader?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>My number one advice would be to learn how to manage your risk and control your emotions when trading.<\/p>\n<p>And if this is truly something you are passionate about, learn to fall in love with the process of accepting losses and studying hard of how and why these markets move.<\/p>\n<p>Trading is a marathon, not a sprint. If you put time, effort and passion into learning it, it can be extremely rewarding.<\/p>\n<h3>Risk management is everything &#8211; Trader Aman<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/amanp.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-395033\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/amanp-300x300.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/amanp-300x300.jpeg 300w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/amanp-80x80.jpeg 80w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/amanp-768x768.jpeg 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/amanp-36x36.jpeg 36w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/amanp-180x180.jpeg 180w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/amanp-705x705.jpeg 705w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/amanp.jpeg 960w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>How does passing the Challenge and Verification changed your life?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s allowed me the opportunity to work with more capital and over time I&#8217;ll be able to further increase the amount of capital I have available to me.
