The latter is involved in traditional proprietary trading, in which firms most often trade directly in a real market environment on their own account through their employees or outsourced traders. Founded back in 2014, Quantlane is a group of traders, quant analysts, mathematicians and developers who trade on many exchanges around the world, using state-of-the-art strategies based on statistical market analysis and deep product knowledge.<\/p>\n<p>For FTMO, this acquisition is a combination of expertise, innovation and a shared vision of unlimited possibilities in trading.

The most important qualities and skills of successful traders include discipline, consistency and the ability to control their emotions..<\/p>\n<p>If you are not able to be <a href=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/en\/you-cant-expect-miracles-from-a-small-account\/\">disciplined enough<\/a> and follow your rules, you cannot be successful in the long run. You can have a sophisticated strategy, a mastered technical system and a good trading plan, but if you can&#8217;t follow them in real trading, it most likely won&#8217;t work.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/en\/scaling-plan\/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=banner&amp;utm_campaign=premiumprogramme\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-546367 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_3-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"130\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_3-1.png 800w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_3-1-300x49.png 300w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_3-1-768x125.png 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_3-1-705x115.png 705w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_3-1-24x4.png 24w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_3-1-36x6.png 36w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_3-1-48x8.png 48w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/en\/consistency-is-very-important-for-success-in-trading\/\">Consistency<\/a> is also very important. Big fluctuations may not be a problem, but quick gains are no guarantee of long-term success. A consistent approach may not result in immediate big gains, but in the long run it is definitely better to achieve average returns on a regular basis.<\/p>\n<p>Emotional control is also an essential skill without which you are unlikely to achieve long-term success in the markets. Emotions affect every trader, but the most experienced and successful ones manage to suppress them because they know that emotions lead to mistakes and therefore to losses. This is also related to patience, which is also lacking in most novice traders who want to make as much money as possible right away. We keep saying here that trading is not a sprint, but a marathon. The sooner you realise this, the easier it will be to avoid the big disappointment that your results are not what you imagined them to be when you started.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to these skills, you must of course master some technical matters such as risk management and <a href=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/en\/why-is-it-important-to-have-a-consistent-rrr\/\">money management<\/a> rules. You also cannot succeed without setting these rules and then following them. FTMO Traders are well aware that without clear risk management rules, they would not be able to pass the <a href=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/en\/#evaluation-process\">Evaluation Process<\/a>. And we are glad that our rules regarding maximum losses are a motivation for them to trade seriously.<\/p>\n<p>An integral part of successful traders is also a trading plan and a robust strategy. Without a proper trading plan, you may find out many things when it is too late, or it may cost you much more time than you expected to achieve long-term success. <a href=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/en\/gambling-is-not-the-right-way-to-make-money\/\">A strategy<\/a> doesn&#8217;t have to be complicated, what&#8217;s important is that it suits you and your trading style, so it&#8217;s important that you take real care when putting it together and don&#8217;t try to copy strategies from other traders.<\/p>\n<h2>What does FTMO have to offer?<\/h2>\n<p>FTMO offers its clients many useful applications and tools to help them achieve better results in their trading journey.
