Meaning that if I risk 1%, I will have a 2% gain or more, which I am gaining more than what I am risking. The strategy I use is the Wycoff method which is market structure and phases. I also use fundamentals to know what is driving price a certain way as well.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What do you think is the key for long-term success in trading?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Thinking long term is one of the best ways to manifest a happy successful life. I believe setting, writing, and planning out your trading goals towards the next 5-10 years is significant. The key is deciding what one wants to achieve in life, a monthly target percentage one wants to make, and what one decides to do with the capital they initially made. It is very strategic to plan ahead the next 5-10 years, even 20 years and more.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What would you like to say to other traders that are attempting the FTMO Challenge?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Stick to your strategy and don&#8217;t give up!<\/p>\n<h3>Risk management is the biggest key to your success &#8211; Trader Justin<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/justinp-scaled.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-395858\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/justinp-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/justinp-225x300.jpg 225w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/justinp-773x1030.jpg 773w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/justinp-768x1024.jpg 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/justinp-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/justinp-1536x2048.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/justinp-1125x1500.jpg 1125w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/justinp-529x705.jpg 529w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/justinp-scaled.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>Do you plan to take another FTMO Challenge to manage even bigger capital?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t plan on taking another Challenge right away, but after the first month, I&#8217;d like to take two more Challenges.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What do you think is the key for long-term success in trading?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Risk management is the biggest key to yo success as a trader.

Define your risk tolerance, entry rules, patterns, how many trades you can lose in one day, etc. Then you enter the market and just have to execute the plan. If this plan has been backtested at least 100x through historical data and has proven to be profitable. You follow the plan.<\/p>\n<p><strong>One piece of advice for people starting the FTMO Challenge now.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Do not enter this Challenge with a defined set of rules that you have backtested at least 100 times.

The big old FOMO. It was days 2 and 3 of the verification and because of FOMO and being stubborn it cost me -5.8% and I had to come back from that. It quickly made me realize how crucial psychology is and that it is ok not to be right and just let it go.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What was the hardest obstacle on your trading journey?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The psychology and then not sticking to the trading plan. One thing that I also find being an obstacle is trying to predict what will happen and then trading on that prediction instead of allowing the market to do what it wants to do and then taking the positions according to that and if it is according to your prediction, great and if not then all the better as you waited for the market to show what it is going to do.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What was easier than expected during the FTMO Challenge or Verification?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I did not think I will be able to finish in time, but there was ample time if you have a good strategy and trading according to the strategy.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/schalkm.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-395873\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/schalkm.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1031\" height=\"977\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/schalkm.jpg 1031w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/schalkm-300x284.jpg 300w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/schalkm-768x728.jpg 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/schalkm-705x668.jpg 705w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1031px) 100vw, 1031px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>How would you rate your experience with FTMO?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Excellent.

The verification was also easier due to the fact of having more time and having a less % gain to achieve. Knowing that I do not need to rush anything but to have more time to find better trades.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What do you think is the key for long-term success in trading?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The major key for me is being sure to be kept up to date to the current market conditions for example markets have changed since the pandemic and even though it was difficult at first as a trader in the month of April. You will have to adapt to it and be up to date on fundamentals and the larger TF technical analysis.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How did you manage your emotions when you were in a losing trade?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>My emotions were actually very calm at no point were I worried, panicking, or sad. I managed to pull through because of the countless hours and 2 years of work in the forex market. I am an outgoing person I will go to the gym or gold to release stress which I believe is a huge factor for managing my emotions.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/ethanm.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-395879\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/ethanm.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1002\" height=\"999\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/ethanm.jpg 1002w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/ethanm-300x300.jpg 300w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/ethanm-80x80.jpg 80w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/ethanm-768x766.jpg 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/ethanm-36x36.jpg 36w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/ethanm-180x180.jpg 180w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/ethanm-705x703.jpg 705w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1002px) 100vw, 1002px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>How does passing the FTMO Challenge and Verification changed your life?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This is just the beginning I&#8217;m entering this part not knowing how it will be trading with such a huge amount of capital.
