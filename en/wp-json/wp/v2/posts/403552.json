I have to continuously practice self-control i.e. do not enter new positions or multiple positions to ensure I have a safe &amp; healthy buffer every day. I also learned to stop trading once I have hit my daily profit target to ensure I did not overtrade. This most difficult rule has been a perfect training ground to increase my self-control in trading.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What inspires you to pursue trading?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Time Freedom i.e. quality time with my family. Since I started trading in February 2016, I have set in my mind that I need to be a full-time trader so that I can have freedom in managing and utilizing my time to do what I am passionate about and to really spent quality time with my family.
