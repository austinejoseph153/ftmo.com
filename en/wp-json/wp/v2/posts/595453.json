I mean you know your limits and you can\u2019t overtrade otherwise you are out. So, it gives you that time to calm down your emotions and gives you another chance, another day to make better decisions with a cooler head.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Has your psychology ever affected your trading plan?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Definitely, it\u2019s the core of everything. I can have 10 great days but if I fail the 11th and wipe out all my profit then it\u2019s for nothing. This happened to me many times and I know you should never get overconfident about your results even though you feel like you are the king of the world at that moment.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What inspires you to pursue trading?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Vision of financial freedom,a better understanding of how financial world works, being able to manage my time my own way and not be dependent on a 9-5 job.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-595490 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/Peter-trades.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"903\" height=\"1305\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/Peter-trades.png 903w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/Peter-trades-208x300.png 208w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/Peter-trades-713x1030.png 713w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/Peter-trades-768x1110.png 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/Peter-trades-488x705.png 488w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 903px) 100vw, 903px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>What was more difficult than expected during your FTMO Challenge or Verification?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Trying it 3 times and failing and at the end of the 4th time it went well. Definitely, you are sometimes overexcited about taking the Challenge and seeing that you can become a pro. So, you take a huge trade in the early stage and if it goes bad it frustrates you and can stick with you. This happened to me and that\u2019s why I failed 3 times.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How did you eliminate the factor of luck in your trading?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>By carefully watching my trading habits and sticking with the good ones. I mean, when you trade you need to know when not to trade, when you are in control of the position, the most important thing is to get those great entries when you are instantly in the profit and you need to watch pattern, price levels, price actions, choose the right asset (choosing stronger currencies against weaker ones).<\/p>\n<p><strong>One piece of advice for people starting the Challenge now.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Don\u2019t get overexcited when you start and don\u2019t take huge trades at the beginning.

Many traders shared their experiences and insights about FTMO, which helped me gain knowledge about the company and its programs. Additionally, I also conducted research on their official website to gather more information and understand the details of their trading Challenges and funding programs.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Has your psychology ever affected your trading plan?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Yes, there have been instances where my psychology has affected my trading plan. Emotions like fear, greed, or impatience can lead to deviations from my planned trading strategy. It&#8217;s crucial to recognize and address these emotional influences to ensure that I stick to my trading plan and make decisions based on a rational analysis of the market rather than being swayed by emotions. Developing emotional discipline is an ongoing process in trading.<\/p>\n<p><strong>One piece of advice for people starting their FTMO Challenge now.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>My advice for people starting their FTMO Challenge now is to prioritize risk management above all else. Focus on preserving your trading capital by adhering to strict risk limits and maintaining discipline in your trading decisions. Patience and consistency are key. Additionally, thoroughly understand and practice your chosen trading strategy before and during the Challenge to increase your chances of success.

It was a mental game. I personally grew a little bit impatient and just wanted to pass and that made the losses hurt more because it felt like they were just prolonging the inevitable.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What does your risk management plan look like?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I risk about 0.5% per trade on the account. That would be $250 of the $50,000 account, I stop trading after 2 full R losses in the day. For each trade where I do risk 0.5%, I will still have a \u201ccut early\u201d plan and that is usually between 40-60% of my SL on that trade. I use value areas (in relation to previous days) and points of control as cut-off points.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Has your psychology ever affected your trading plan?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Yes, usually when it comes to profit-taking. I catch myself cashing out early sometimes when I have set a TP instead of watching the price interact with that level and see if further continuation happens. I like the idea of taking my crumbs from the market consistently to build a loaf rather than taking the whole loaf up front. Sometimes I will but I have found (especially in shorts) that reversals can be quick, and you can end up with less than you originally thought.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-595514\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/Kachi-trades.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"904\" height=\"1325\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/Kachi-trades.png 904w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/Kachi-trades-205x300.png 205w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/Kachi-trades-703x1030.png 703w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/Kachi-trades-768x1126.png 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/Kachi-trades-481x705.png 481w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 904px) 100vw, 904px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>What was the hardest obstacle on your trading journey?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Integrating auction ranges with efficient timing.
