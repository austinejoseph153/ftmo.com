In this article, we will take a look at backtesting basics and show you how you can make most of it to gain confidence in your trading.<\/span><\/em><\/p>\n<h2>Guide to Forex Backtesting &#8211; Gain confidence in your trading strategy<\/h2>\n<p>There is one thing that connects all professional traders &#8211; they have 100% trust in their trading strategy.<\/p>\n<p>If you want to join this elite club of traders, you need to know what to expect from your trading strategy.<\/p>\n<p>This is quite a complicated task since none of us can see the future, but thanks to the historical data, we can easily see how we would have performed in the past.<\/p>\n<p>If we can find out that our trading strategy performed well in the last couple of years, there is a very small chance it won&#8217;t work in the future.<\/p>\n<p><strong>So what is backtesting?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>While we backtest, we put our strategy to test on historical data.<\/p>\n<p>This can be done over the last couple of months but you can also go 10 or 20 years back.<\/p>\n<p>It all depends on your appetite and how robust you want your backtest to be.<\/p>\n<p>Although backtesting can be very time consuming, it is relatively easy.<\/p>\n<p>All you need is a trading platform with enough historical data and a simple excel sheet where you will document all trades.<\/p>\n<h2>Types of backtesting<\/h2>\n<p>There are two types of backtesting, manual and automated.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Manual backtesting<\/strong> is as straight as it gets.<\/p>\n<p>You just need to open the platform and look, day by day, for valid trading setups you would trade in real-time.<\/p>\n<p>After every trade, you log it into your spreadsheet and carry on.<\/p>\n<p>This can be quite a long process and most importantly you need to be 100% true with yourself.<\/p>\n<p>One of the mistakes traders do with backtesting is they try to &#8220;curve-fit&#8221; strategy so it would bring a positive expectancy.<\/p>\n<p>An example of this can be when the trading setup would present itself in the middle of the night where you won&#8217;t be able to execute it, or your stop loss would get hit by spread and you completely ignore this fact and register the trade anyway.<\/p>\n<p>You have to realize that by doing this, you are only hurting yourself as you will lose money in the live market conditions.<\/p>\n<p>The second type of backtesting is fully <strong>automated<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>For this type of backtesting, you often need knowledge of some programming language.<\/p>\n<p>It is mostly Python, MQL or C++.<\/p>\n<p>A huge pro of automated backtesting is that it completely removes all emotions and time you need to spend on going day by day on historical data.<\/p>\n<p>The downside of it is that you need to invest quite some time in learning the programming language.<\/p>\n<h2>Important Backtesting Statistics<\/h2>\n<p>When you are running a backtest these are the most important statistics you should keep track of.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Time and Date of entry<\/li>\n<li>Entry and Exit price<\/li>\n<li>Position size and % risk on your trading account<\/li>\n<li>MAE \u2013 Maximal Adverse Excursion<\/li>\n<li>MFE \u2013 Maximal Favorable Excursion<\/li>\n<li>Average R: R ratio<\/li>\n<li>Strike rate<\/li>\n<li>Maximum drawdown<\/li>\n<li>Long\/short ratio<\/li>\n<li>The success rate on different instruments<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If possible, it is good to also add the screenshot to all the trades in your backtest. This way, you can easily come back to it later.<\/p>\n<h2>How many trades should be backtested?<\/h2>\n<p>Some traders might test the first ten trades and if they see their strategy works, they decide it is just enough and give up on further backtesting.<\/p>\n<p>This is definitely not a good approach as you don&#8217;t have a robust data sample.<\/p>\n<p>To be really sure your trading system is stable and robust, you need a sample size of at least 100-200 trades.<\/p>\n<p>This way you will gain much more confidence in your trading.<\/p>\n<p>Although trading in the real market is always different from testing your strategy on the demo, you will gain much more confidence knowing that your strategy has a positive expectancy over the long run.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>There are countless ways of making money in Forex.
