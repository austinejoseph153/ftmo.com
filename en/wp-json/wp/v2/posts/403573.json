It can be an easy thing to lose of and without proper risk management, it will make or break your ability to be profitable. After analyzing my trades I learned that I was allowing my emotions to play a huge role in my strategy and was actually hindering it rather than helping it. It really put my character and strategy to the test but I pursued my goals and achieved them by becoming a better trader overall.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Where have you learnt about FTMO?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I have learned that not just anyone can become an FTMO trader and be successful. It takes a lot of patience and discipline and as long as you have both you can become a huge asset to yourself and the company at the same time.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What was more difficult than expected during your FTMO Challenge or Verification?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The verification was much more difficult. This was so in my case because after passing two of the challenges I had signed up for I was very confident that I was gonna finish the verification faster and more easily which became a huge problem because I would not follow my plan all the way. When doing the verification you have to keep in mind that it is not over yet and nothing is secure for you so keep following your plan and respect the limits\/risk at all costs.<\/p>\n<p><a class=\"lightbox-added aligncenter\" href=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/pedrom.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-401789\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/pedrom-1030x970.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1030px) 100vw, 1030px\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/pedrom-1030x970.png 1030w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/pedrom-300x283.png 300w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/pedrom-768x723.png 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/pedrom-1536x1447.png 1536w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/pedrom-1500x1413.png 1500w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/pedrom-705x664.png 705w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/pedrom.png 1854w\" alt=\"\" width=\"1030\" height=\"970\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>How would you rate your experience with FTMO?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I am very pleased so far.

Respect the limits at all costs and know that if you have all the above then the probabilities of passing the challenge will be much much higher. Remember that this is more of a challenge versus yourself and it can only take one poorly managed trade to put you back at the start.
