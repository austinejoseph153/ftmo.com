I passed 2 100k Challenges and I have another 100k Challenge close to passing the Verification stage and I just started another 100k Challenge.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What do you think is the most important characteristic\/attribute to become a profitable trader?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I\u2019d say at a base level you have to have passion and love for the game along with drive, discipline, and focus. But sometimes taking a break can be beneficial. You just have to listen to yourself. I took a year and a half break from trading after 4 years of working hard at it and it was actually super helpful, and it allowed me to come back to it with a new set of eyes and I started seeing things in a new way. Not saying you have to take that long of a break but that helped me a lot.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How did you manage your emotions when you were in a losing trade?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Nobody likes losing but you have to become good at losing to be successful. Once I realized that a losing trade was just falling on the wrong side of probability relative to me (assuming you didn\u2019t make any technical or psychological mistakes) then it didn\u2019t bother me anymore because I trust my edge. But sometimes I would get a little worried when I\u2019m on a big losing streak. To put my mind at ease I\u2019d check my trades and if the answer was yes, I would take those trades again even though they lost then I know I\u2019m doing everything right and it\u2019s just probability playing out (in this case a bunch of losers in a row).<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-602988 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/Nicholas-trades.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"905\" height=\"1231\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/Nicholas-trades.png 905w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/Nicholas-trades-221x300.png 221w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/Nicholas-trades-757x1030.png 757w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/Nicholas-trades-768x1045.png 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/Nicholas-trades-518x705.png 518w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 905px) 100vw, 905px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Do you have a trading plan in place, and do you follow it strictly?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Yes. I have a small playbook of memorized rules I made for myself, and I follow it strictly 99% of the time. If I make a mistake, then I forgive myself and add a solution to the playbook and now if I make that same mistake again it\u2019s unacceptable. Good to read the playbook everyday if you don\u2019t have it memorized.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What was more difficult than expected during your FTMO Challenge or Verification?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I\u2019d say the hardest part was not having the previous gains from the last stage to give you a buffer. After the first stage, the account gets reset back to baseline so I would get a little stressed if I entered a small losing streak right away. But I didn\u2019t let that affect my trading. I still remained consistent. You cannot trade with a fear of loss.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What would you like to say to other traders who are attempting an FTMO Challenge?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Make sure you have proven data on spreadsheets that prove you have an edge in what you\u2019re going to do. Have a plan and a playbook. Don\u2019t go in blind and hope to get lucky. The first thing is to build that data and spreadsheet (I used a year&#8217;s worth of data) and the next is to tweak variables like entries and exits to your liking and create a losing streak chart to make sure you don\u2019t drawdown more than 10% too often. Once you have all that then working on your trading psychology is last so you can effectively take your paper trade results into a market where you have skin in the game.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/trader.ftmo.com\/start-challenge?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=banner&amp;utm_campaign=tradersqa\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-546404 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_1-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"130\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_1-1.png 800w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_1-1-300x49.png 300w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_1-1-768x125.png 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_1-1-705x115.png 705w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_1-1-24x4.png 24w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_1-1-36x6.png 36w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_1-1-48x8.png 48w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Trader Guadalupe: \u201cThe easiest part was managing my risk because that was something that I could control.\u201d<\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-602955\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/Guadalupe-225x300.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/Guadalupe-225x300.jpeg 225w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/Guadalupe-773x1030.jpeg 773w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/Guadalupe-768x1024.jpeg 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/Guadalupe-1152x1536.jpeg 1152w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/Guadalupe-1536x2048.jpeg 1536w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/Guadalupe-1125x1500.jpeg 1125w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/Guadalupe-529x705.jpeg 529w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/Guadalupe-scaled.jpeg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Do you plan to take another FTMO Challenge to manage even bigger capital?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Yes, I plan to max allocate.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What do you think is the key to long-term success in trading?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The key to long term success is being disciplined enough to know when to walk away from a trading day.
