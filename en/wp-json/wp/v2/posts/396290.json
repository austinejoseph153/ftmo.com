If it&#8217;s a high-quality decision, that&#8217;s all good, no matter the result of the trade.<\/p>\n<p>If for some reason it&#8217;s a bad decision then learn from that and improve your edge.<\/p>\n<p>True edge plays out when you take many trades and you are able to survive any drawdown that may happen.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s like tossing a coin that is biased towards your bet.

I put in the work: &#8211; I prepare my trading plan every morning &#8211; I end each day doing an overview of what happened in the market, how it was trading, judge quality of my decision, log trades and lessons learned &#8211; I focus on a single market at a time (DAX), and two markets in total (DAX and SPX) &#8211; I go through the charts and my journal every weekend to refresh what I had learned during the week &#8211; I set a goal for each session which most often is eliminating a mistake (like taking profit too soon) or getting better at something (like staying focused longer) &#8211; I make sure I recover well. Except for occasionally watching a movie, I&#8217;m trying to stay away from screens for any non-work-related reasons.

My performance on the challenge and verification stages came with some bumps in the road, but with perseverance and discipline, I was finally able to pass! My first attempt started the same week of the global shutdowns in March due to covid19 and that challenge attempt didn&#8217;t go as planned to say the least. Never the less, after a few more attempts and with the market volatility calming down in some capacity throughout the summer, I was finally able to have my breakthrough. Customer support has been stellar throughout my whole process and they are on point in responding first thing the next business day. Great experience for me so far and highly recommended for all traders looking to have some additional capital!<\/p>\n<p><strong>Do you have a trading plan in place, and do you follow it strictly?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I have been able to develop a pretty strong trading plan for myself that is tailored to me and my time zone here on the west coast of the U.S. I work on keeping my position sizing consistent and limiting the amount of risk in play at one time. I have been able to dial in the particular times of the New York\/London session that have given me consistency and been able to have a routine to where I&#8217;m still able to enjoy the rest of my day and organize other non-trading activities. In detail, I wake up early during the week to gauge the sentiment from the previous sessions and analyze the futures numbers before the New York open to get an overall feel. I already have pairs in mind from my weekend prep and previous day prep so I know what I&#8217;m looking to trade. From there, I simply use a 20 EMA, reversion to mean analysis, some core patterns for context, and pivot points where price has seen lots of reactions.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/brianm.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-396312\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/brianm.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1022\" height=\"984\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/brianm.jpg 1022w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/brianm-300x289.jpg 300w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/brianm-768x739.jpg 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/brianm-36x36.jpg 36w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/brianm-705x679.jpg 705w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1022px) 100vw, 1022px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>Where have you learnt about FTMO?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I heard about FTMO through multiple trading podcasts.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Has your psychology ever affected your trading plan?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Oh yeah psychology is always in play every trading day, but dialing down the specific times of the trading day and realizing that I don&#8217;t have to trade all sessions to be profitable has helped minimize the negative psychological effects. Another big action I took that has helped me tremendously was unfollowing the majority of trading pages on all social media platforms. That exposure over time became a nuisance to my own way I saw and traded the market. Granted, they had their time and place at the beginning of my trading career, but overtime it started to turn into noise rather than useful information.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How does your risk management plan look like?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m strict on maintaining consistent position sizing for all positions. More than not, I&#8217;ll close all positions before the end of the trading day here in the U.S. to avoid any sudden breaking news or events during the Tokyo and early London sessions. This particular action has helped with me to carry on with the rest of my day stress free and be able to have a daily life balance. If I hit a daily loss in the 1.5-2% range then I&#8217;ll cut it off for the day. To top it off, I don&#8217;t trade more than 2 pairs at a time to limit my exposure.<\/p>\n<p><strong>One piece of advice for people starting the FTMO Challenge now<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>Never give up, find a balance between trading and regular life activities, cut out the noise on social media, maintain strict risk management guidelines, find pairs that work the best to the times of the trading session that work best for yourself, and plainly just believe in yourself.<\/p>\n<h3>Trader Diego &#8211; Learn about random distribution<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/diegop.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-396315 size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/diegop-177x300.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"177\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/diegop-177x300.png 177w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/diegop.png 409w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 177px) 100vw, 177px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>What was more difficult than expected during your FTMO Challenge or Verification?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Not trying to rush the process.
