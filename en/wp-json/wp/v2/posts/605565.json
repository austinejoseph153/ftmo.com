But I learned that never move your stop loss thinking the market is going to come back and bounce back up.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Describe your best trade.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>My best trade was with US30, it was the perfect set up like everything on my trading plan was right in place, so I took the trade, and it hit my TP.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-606072 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/Ndecham-trades.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"908\" height=\"1259\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/Ndecham-trades.png 908w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/Ndecham-trades-216x300.png 216w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/Ndecham-trades-743x1030.png 743w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/Ndecham-trades-768x1065.png 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/Ndecham-trades-508x705.png 508w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 908px) 100vw, 908px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>What was the most difficult during your FTMO Challenge or Verification, and how did you overcome it?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The most difficult about the challenges was the number of days you have to trade because I remember on my Verification stage, I took a trade the same day I took my account, and it was up $600, so I had to figure out a way to close the trade with less than $500 the first day. So, I took a trade against the market, took a lost, and it went down to $400. I then closed the trade and traded the remaining $100 in the next three days.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What inspires you to pursue trading?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I guess discipline because I used to have a friend, he was trading. He told me trading comes with discipline. If you\u2019re not disciplined enough, I don\u2019t think you can make it, so that\u2019s what I really like about it.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What is the number one advice you would give to a new trader?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>There is no exact perfect trading strategy out there. I used to watch hundreds of strategies on YouTube, and nothing worked. The only thing that\u2019s gonna work for you is your own. You have to figure out what is going to work for you. There is no perfect strategy, you make your own strategy.<\/p>\n<h3>Trader Charlie: \u201cSet realistic expectations of yourself at the start of journey\u201d<\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-605575\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/Charlie-137x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"137\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/Charlie-137x300.jpg 137w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/Charlie-469x1030.jpg 469w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/Charlie-321x705.jpg 321w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/Charlie.jpg 567w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 137px) 100vw, 137px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>What was more difficult than expected during your FTMO Challenge or Verification?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Verification definitely, I&#8217;ve been trying to pass for about a year and after finally finishing 3 trials over 2 months I really flew through the Challenge phase. But with getting to phase 2 for the first time, some nerves kicked in, and I almost slipped into an old bad habit.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What was the hardest obstacle on your trading journey?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Emotional stability. Meaning, once the trade is active my heart used to pound hard, and I would make emotional, irrational decisions from that state of mind only to later analyse the move and see what I should have done. Working hard on myself for a solid year, reading trading psychology books and listening to the right people has now finally allowed me to trade worry and stress-free. But it was a rocky journey.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How did you manage your emotions when you were in a losing trade?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Practise, practise, practise. For 2 years I didn&#8217;t do it very well until I got an excellent mentor who not only taught me a brilliant strategy but also how to manage your trade and your emotions. So now if I ever feel nauseous, I work on breath, I listen to classical music and If I&#8217;m being honest smoke. All these things help me build a calming environment to trade emotionlessly.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-606080\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/Charlie-trades.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"909\" height=\"1259\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/Charlie-trades.png 909w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/Charlie-trades-217x300.png 217w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/Charlie-trades-744x1030.png 744w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/Charlie-trades-768x1064.png 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/Charlie-trades-509x705.png 509w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 909px) 100vw, 909px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>What was easier than expected during the FTMO Challenge or Verification?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The first 10+ challenges felt impossible, going from drawdown to profit, never really getting anywhere.

I can&#8217;t say it was easy because it&#8217;s 3 years work compressed into a couple of days of good results, but I traded with ease for sure.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/trader.ftmo.com\/start-challenge?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=banner&amp;utm_campaign=tradersqa\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-546404 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_1-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"130\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_1-1.png 800w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_1-1-300x49.png 300w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_1-1-768x125.png 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_1-1-705x115.png 705w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_1-1-24x4.png 24w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_1-1-36x6.png 36w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_1-1-48x8.png 48w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>What do you think is the key for long term success in trading?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Set realistic expectations of yourself at the start of the journey, or even if you\u2019re a few years in. Allow yourself time to make mistakes and document these mistakes. Don&#8217;t do what I and many other traders do and spend your last money on this dream to believe that &#8220;now I understand this, this is easy, I&#8217;m going to get rich&#8221;. It will backfire and hurt a lot.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What is the number one advice you would give to a new trader?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Really take your time, use a low risk to start off, learn from everyone and most importantly from yourself. Another thing is to understand that your ego will try and trick you into thinking you understand the markets because you had a good win streak. The market is ruthless, and you never need to know what will happen next in order for you to make money. Backtest, backtest, backtest is a very underrated feature that needs to be leveraged more by traders, especially new ones, as it\u2019s risk-free evidence of your start working or not.<\/p>\n<h3>Trader Frances Anne: \u201cDiscipline really is the key.\u201d<\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-605583\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/Frances-Anne-160x300.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"160\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/Frances-Anne-160x300.jpeg 160w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/Frances-Anne-548x1030.jpeg 548w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/Frances-Anne-768x1445.jpeg 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/Frances-Anne-817x1536.jpeg 817w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/Frances-Anne-1089x2048.jpeg 1089w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/Frances-Anne-798x1500.jpeg 798w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/Frances-Anne-375x705.jpeg 375w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/Frances-Anne-scaled.jpeg 1361w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 160px) 100vw, 160px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>How did you eliminate the factor of luck in your trading?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This time around, I really tried to stick to my system and only take trades if\/when I get my trigger.

FTMO is leader of the pack.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What was more difficult than expected during your FTMO Challenge or Verification?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I wouldn&#8217;t say difficult but especially in my Verification phase, I had one loss over \u00a3700 and after that, I have only taken trades based on my triggers\/system religiously. Hence, took lesser trades. Every system isn\u2019t perfect, and it doesn\u2019t always work, as the market will do what it wants to do. So, for following trades after the +\u00a3700 loss, I would realise that my trade was not ideal or was wrong and therefore would abort &#8211; I exit at breakeven or in whatever little green I can muster. This meant that my wins following the loss were less than the first initial loss. It affected my RRR negatively, even though the win rate looked great. This was on oversight from my end. Although I ended up in profit, I have to be careful in the long run as ideally, RRR and win rate along with profit factor should ideally always reflect profitability.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What is the number one advice you would give to a new trader?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Discipline.
