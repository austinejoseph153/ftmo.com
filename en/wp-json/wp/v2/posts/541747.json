Losses in trading can quickly escalate and make you lose the Challenge or the account. It is important to stay neutral after losses and not become emotional, which would make your trading lose significantly in terms of quality.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>What would you like to say to other traders that are attempting the FTMO Challenge?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The biggest advice I could give is to always operate with a fixed risk and after taking a loss to take a couple hours without trading to reevaluate. One of my larger mistakes was turning small losses into large ones just by trying to catch up instantly on bad trades. Rather, it is much more efficient to stay out of the market for a bit, and only come back when other trades feel confident in the overall trading strategy developed.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Trader Jazmine: &#8220;You can have the most accurate analysis in the world but if you do not manage your risk properly, you are setting yourself up for failure.&#8221;<\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-541771\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Jazmine-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Jazmine-225x300.jpg 225w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Jazmine-773x1030.jpg 773w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Jazmine-768x1024.jpg 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Jazmine-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Jazmine-1536x2048.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Jazmine-1125x1500.jpg 1125w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Jazmine-529x705.jpg 529w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Jazmine-18x24.jpg 18w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Jazmine-27x36.jpg 27w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Jazmine-36x48.jpg 36w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Jazmine-scaled.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Jazmine.heic\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-541764\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Jazmine.heic\" alt=\"\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><b>Do you plan to take another FTMO Challenge to manage an even bigger capital?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Absolutely.

Firstly, I always trade my setups. Even if this means missing a few trades. Following my trading plan gives me an edge in the market. Secondly, I never risk more than 2% of my capital\/trade. Usually, my risk is 1% but depending upon the scenario, it could vary between 1%-2% but never over 2%. When I have to take multiple positions, my combined risk never exceeds 2.5%. Also, I\u2019ll usually make my first trade breakeven before executing the second one.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>How did you eliminate the factor of luck in your trading?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Luck was never a factor in my trading. Of course, I had several trades, which I won despite the price going against me, at first but I think that is just the probability. I try to always think in probabilities, and stick to my trading plan, even if that means missing a few good trades. Outcome of a trade does not affect my emotional state.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Where have you learnt about FTMO?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I have been following FTMO for a few years now, and it was the first prop firm I saw on the internet.

I lacked motivation to trade because losing or winning a dollar\/trade doesn\u2019t make any difference. I really wanted to pursue trading full time but arranging money for a sizeable account is a major roadblock, and even if you have the funds, a retail trader never gets raw spreads. I needed a sizeable account that could cover my salary. So, these things kept me out of trading for a few years. FTMO made it possible for me to trade full time and make a decent living out of it. Passing the FTMO Challenge and Verification made me a better risk manager and a good trader. Really grateful that FTMO exists.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>How did you manage your emotions when you were in a losing trade?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Outcome of the trade doesn\u2019t affect my emotions anymore. It took me a lot of time and effort to get to this state of mind, and I know I have a long road in front of me. I am aware that I can\u2019t win all the trades I take and winning or losing is just a probability game. Whenever I enter a trade, I usually write down the logic of executing the trade and the risk associated with the trade. At the end of the day, I read my journal and see if there was something I missed and document my performance.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>What is the number one advice you would give to a new trader?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Invest in psychology.
