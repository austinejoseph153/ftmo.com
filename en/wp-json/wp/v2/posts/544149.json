Even though I use the swing account model, I still personally choose to avoid certain high impact news releases and weekend holding as and when deemed appropriate.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What was more difficult than expected during your FTMO Challenge or Verification?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Psychology &#8211; I thought I had my psychology on lock having already been learning trading for a number of years. However, doing the Evaluation Process with a profit target to reach within a limited amount of time really tested my psychology. I initially was avoiding taking trade opportunities that ended up going on to win due to me overthinking things. The pressure of a profit target and time limit was something I had to overcome, particularly in the FTMO Challenge stage. Once I rectified this, I saw my trading in the Evaluation Process go to another level.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Has your psychology ever affected your trading plan?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Yeah, during the Evaluation Process it did at one point early on, \u00a0as described above. Also, early on in my trading journey it did as it does with every trader &#8211; you assume trading is just technical, but as you become more experienced you realize risk management and psychology are the 2 most important things in trading before you are even able to allow yourself to benefit from your trading edge.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-544201\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Raymond-trades.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"912\" height=\"1201\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Raymond-trades.png 912w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Raymond-trades-228x300.png 228w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Raymond-trades-782x1030.png 782w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Raymond-trades-768x1011.png 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Raymond-trades-535x705.png 535w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Raymond-trades-18x24.png 18w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Raymond-trades-27x36.png 27w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Raymond-trades-36x48.png 36w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 912px) 100vw, 912px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Describe your best trade.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve had some good trades in my personal trading account over the years, but with regards to the Evaluation Process, it was during my Verification. It was a GBPUSD trade that banked me around $11,164.06 &#8211; it was a key trade as it got me out of drawdown and was really a turning point in my Verification where I felt confident in passing.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How has passing the FTMO Challenge and Verification changed your life?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Mentally and spiritually, I feel amazing and a lot more like myself. I&#8217;ve been so focused on achieving this goal over the past year, putting on hold some other dreams and aspirations I have, adapting my trading, putting in those hours, being patient in waiting before I took another FTMO Challenge. That hard work feels like it has finally paid off. I still have so much left to do, but this is a big, crucial and essential step. Once I start making withdrawals, that is when I will really start to see the financial change in my life I\u2019ve long been wanting and working so hard towards &#8211; excited for the future but still so much to do. Mainly, I\u2019m focused and excited for what the remainder of 2023 holds and beyond.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What is the number one advice you would give to a new trader?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Show profitability in your strategy in backtesting over a long time period (relative to the timeframe you trade on) and make sure it is multiple backtests that you do, not just one &#8211; maybe 3-5 &#8211; just to prove there really is an edge in your strategy. Spend a month or two demo trading, then after this deposit a small amount of money you can afford to lose and start with live trading. Once you start to see some consistency in your live trading, you can then decide whether you feel confident enough to put more money in your trading account. Also, at this point it may be worth taking the FTMO Free Trial to see if you have a good chance of passing the real Evaluation Process. If you then feel confident of passing the Evaluation and you would benefit from more capital, I would certainly recommend taking the FTMO Evaluation Process to become one of their traders! Also BE PATIENT! It may take you years (it takes most years) to become consistently profitable, but it is all worth it. Don&#8217;t beat yourself up because you haven&#8217;t reached where you want to be after a year or two or three, etc. Everyone has their own timing and it&#8217;s a journey. You only fail once you quit &#8211; don&#8217;t ever stop. I know you can do it and you know that too!<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/trader.ftmo.com\/free-trial\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-543706 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Blog-banner-Free-Trial-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"130\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Blog-banner-Free-Trial-1.jpg 800w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Blog-banner-Free-Trial-1-300x49.jpg 300w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Blog-banner-Free-Trial-1-768x125.jpg 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Blog-banner-Free-Trial-1-705x115.jpg 705w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Blog-banner-Free-Trial-1-24x4.jpg 24w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Blog-banner-Free-Trial-1-36x6.jpg 36w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Blog-banner-Free-Trial-1-48x8.jpg 48w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Trader Sean: &#8220;Take a relaxed approach.

Unfortunately, with so much information being available it is very hard to find or to stick to one source of information which causes an overload and confusion. So, filtering what you need the most is certainly making life easier in trading.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What does your risk management plan look like?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I always tend to risk anywhere between 0.5%-1%. So that is essentially my risk plan. I will put the stop loss to entry once I have some profit depending on how the market is looking. But I will move SL to entry, maybe close 50% of the position and ride it out risk free.<\/p>\n<p><strong>One piece of advice for people starting the FTMO Challenge now.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Manage your risk. Don\u2019t worry about it being a Challenge, just treat it like any other account with exceptions to risk sometimes. If you are up a bit and have not many days left, you could increase the risk a little bit to reach that profit target without blowing your profits. So when you&#8217;re in a good position and time is running out I would suggest increasing the risk but not to a point where you will fail if you lose that trade. When in profit you can always retake, so just aim to be in profit.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/trader.ftmo.com\/start-challenge\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-543692 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Blog-banner-Challenge-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"130\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Blog-banner-Challenge-1.jpg 800w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Blog-banner-Challenge-1-300x49.jpg 300w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Blog-banner-Challenge-1-768x125.jpg 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Blog-banner-Challenge-1-705x115.jpg 705w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Blog-banner-Challenge-1-24x4.jpg 24w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Blog-banner-Challenge-1-36x6.jpg 36w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Blog-banner-Challenge-1-48x8.jpg 48w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Trader Cher: Don&#8217;t rush, you have plenty of time, there is no medal for passing the Challenge with one trade, or in one day.<\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-544184\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Cher-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Cher-225x300.jpg 225w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Cher-773x1030.jpg 773w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Cher-768x1024.jpg 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Cher-529x705.jpg 529w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Cher-18x24.jpg 18w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Cher-27x36.jpg 27w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Cher-36x48.jpg 36w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Cher.jpg 897w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>What does your risk management plan look like?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Only risk 0.5%-1% per trade.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Do you plan to take another FTMO Challenge to manage even bigger capital?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Yes, later in the year once I have got settled into this account.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What was the most difficult during your Challenge or Verification and how did you overcome it?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Going into \u00a31k drawdown on day one of the Verification phase.
