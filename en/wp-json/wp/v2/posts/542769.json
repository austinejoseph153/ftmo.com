You can see from his balance curve that it took him a few days at the beginning of the trading period to get a positive account balance and stay there. However, in the following days he was able to maintain a positive return on account, despite two fairly significant drops. Had it not been for a series of losing trades before the end of the trading period, his results could have been much better.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-542675\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Balance-01.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"808\" height=\"661\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Balance-01.png 808w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Balance-01-300x245.png 300w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Balance-01-768x628.png 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Balance-01-705x577.png 705w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Balance-01-24x20.png 24w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Balance-01-36x29.png 36w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Balance-01-48x39.png 48w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 808px) 100vw, 808px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The final profit of nearly $20,000 on a $200,000 account is a very good result. The trader closed his trades on most of the trading days in profit, but at the same time he approached the Maximum Daily Loss limit twice (although still with a relatively safe margin). The Maximum Loss limit was not a problem for him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The average reward\/risk ratio above one (1.97) shows that the trader\u2019s strategy can be profitable in the long run, even with a relatively low win rate (40.65%). He is a relatively active trader, having opened 123 trades with a total size of 1,573.61 lots during the period, which amounts to more than 12 lots per position.

This is not considered as excessive overtrading, but the number of trades is quite high, even for an intraday trader. The biggest problem we see is that the trader tends to frequently increase the amount of open positions at a loss.\u00a0<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/en\/adding-to-a-losing-position-a-risk-that-can-pay-off\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is a very risky strategy and should be only used by very experienced traders<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0who are clear about what they are doing and what risks they are taking.

The ratio of buy and sell orders is rarely balanced, but their success rate plays clearly in favour of short positions, as\u00a0 the trader has made most of his profits on short positions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-542717\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Open-BS-Volume-01.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"811\" height=\"805\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Open-BS-Volume-01.png 811w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Open-BS-Volume-01-300x298.png 300w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Open-BS-Volume-01-80x80.png 80w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Open-BS-Volume-01-768x762.png 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Open-BS-Volume-01-36x36.png 36w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Open-BS-Volume-01-180x180.png 180w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Open-BS-Volume-01-705x700.png 705w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Open-BS-Volume-01-24x24.png 24w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Open-BS-Volume-01-48x48.png 48w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 811px) 100vw, 811px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The second trader whose account was evaluated by us took a diametrically different approach to trading. The first figure shows that his trading period is much shorter and he requested a payout after only two weeks of trading. During that time he had only 11 trades, most of which were profitable, so his balance curve was positive the whole time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-542682\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Balance-02.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"807\" height=\"693\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Balance-02.png 807w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Balance-02-300x258.png 300w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Balance-02-768x660.png 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Balance-02-705x605.png 705w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Balance-02-24x21.png 24w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Balance-02-36x31.png 36w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Balance-02-48x41.png 48w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 807px) 100vw, 807px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Furthermore, only eleven trades were enough for the trader to make a profit of over $18,000, which is a great result for an account size of $100,000. Neither the Maximum Daily Loss nor the Maximum Loss limits were a problem for the trader, thanks to the combination of a very high average RRR (5.17) and a good win rate on trades (63.64%). With eleven trades the trader traded a total of 22.37 lots, which is only something like 2 lots per trade, and is a fairly conservative approach.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-542703\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Objectives-02.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"807\" height=\"975\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Objectives-02.png 807w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Objectives-02-248x300.png 248w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Objectives-02-768x928.png 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Objectives-02-584x705.png 584w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Objectives-02-20x24.png 20w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Objectives-02-30x36.png 30w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Objectives-02-40x48.png 40w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 807px) 100vw, 807px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is clear from the Trading Journal that this trader is a swing trader who holds his positions open for several days, with his longest trade lasting practically the entire trading period. His patience paid off in the end, and thanks to his small positions, the overnight swaps did not affect his profits very much. He even managed to make a profit on the swap fees with his USDJPY position which was also the largest position. We positively evaluate the Stop Loss settings for all his positions. The trader used the earlier mentioned position increase at a loss with his AUDJPY position, but in this case it ended, with a certain amount of luck, with a positive result and it is the trader\u2019s most profitable trade.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-542745\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Trading-journal-02.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"810\" height=\"621\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Trading-journal-02.png 810w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Trading-journal-02-300x230.png 300w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Trading-journal-02-768x589.png 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Trading-journal-02-705x541.png 705w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Trading-journal-02-24x18.png 24w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Trading-journal-02-36x28.png 36w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Trading-journal-02-48x37.png 48w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This trader traded exclusively currency pairs. Interestingly, his worst results were with the AUDCAD pair, which was used in most of his trades. He mostly opened short positions, but with currency pairs we cannot talk about the classic shorting, because it always speculates on the decline of one currency and the strengthening of the other currency. Overall, the trader\u2019s approach can be evaluated positively and it is a good example that less is sometimes more.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-542724\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Open-BS-Volume-02.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"809\" height=\"804\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Open-BS-Volume-02.png 809w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Open-BS-Volume-02-300x298.png 300w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Open-BS-Volume-02-80x80.png 80w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Open-BS-Volume-02-768x763.png 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Open-BS-Volume-02-36x36.png 36w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Open-BS-Volume-02-180x180.png 180w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Open-BS-Volume-02-705x701.png 705w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Open-BS-Volume-02-24x24.png 24w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Open-BS-Volume-02-48x48.png 48w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 809px) 100vw, 809px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The third evaluated trader did not go overboard with the amount of open positions either, but unlike the previous trader, the duration of this trader\u2019s trades was shorter and his position sizes were larger.

The Maximum Daily loss and the Maximum Loss were not a problem for him, and the total profit of over $14,000 on an account size of $200,000 is not a bad result at all. The average RRR (1.30) is also not bad and combined with the good trade win rate (67.86), the trader is able to make good profits in the long run. 138.62 lots for the mentioned number of trades is not a small amount (almost 5 lots per trade), but due to the account size, it is in order.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-542710\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Objectives-03.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"804\" height=\"973\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Objectives-03.png 804w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Objectives-03-248x300.png 248w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Objectives-03-768x929.png 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Objectives-03-583x705.png 583w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Objectives-03-20x24.png 20w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Objectives-03-30x36.png 30w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Objectives-03-40x48.png 40w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 804px) 100vw, 804px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the Trading Journal,\u00a0 his trades usually last for several hours, but the trader only rarely holds them overnight (which is good considering the size of the positions). At the beginning of the year the trader had a losing streak, after which he did not engage in \u201crevenge\u201d trading, which we evaluate positively. The last position on the EURUSD pair is interesting. This trader also tried to use the unfavorable movement of the currency pair to his advantage and opened new positions \u201cat a better price\u201d. At first, this led to a significant loss, but immediately after closing three losing positions, the trader started opening more positions in the same direction and in his second attempt he was already successful. This is a very risky approach and, again, please note that it is not suitable for everyone. On the positive side, the trader had set Stop Losses on all his trades.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-542752\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Trading-journal-03.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"807\" height=\"996\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Trading-journal-03.png 807w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Trading-journal-03-243x300.png 243w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Trading-journal-03-768x948.png 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Trading-journal-03-571x705.png 571w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Trading-journal-03-19x24.png 19w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Trading-journal-03-29x36.png 29w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Trading-journal-03-39x48.png 39w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 807px) 100vw, 807px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The interesting fact is that\u00a0 the trader opened only short positions, which, as we have already mentioned, is not unusual in Forex, but some traders may have a psychological problem with it.
