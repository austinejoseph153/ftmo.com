This of course always has a very positive effect on the psyche, and more experienced traders can use this to their advantage.

On the negative side, the lack of <a href=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/en\/why-trading-without-stop-loss-is-not-a-good-idea\/\">Stop Losses<\/a> can do a lot of damage to a trading account in case of sudden market movements, especially for traders who hold their positions for several days.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-600106\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Journal-01-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"803\" height=\"933\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Journal-01-1.png 803w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Journal-01-1-258x300.png 258w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Journal-01-1-768x892.png 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Journal-01-1-607x705.png 607w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 803px) 100vw, 803px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The trader has traded a few currency pairs, leaving out other types of instruments. At first glance, it may seem that this was a broad diversification, but a look at the list of instruments and the journal shows that he was practically speculating with his positions only on the strengthening of the <a href=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/en\/usdjpy-clash-of-two-cultures-east-and-west\/\">Japanese yen<\/a> and the weakening of the Australian dollar.<\/p>\n<p>Interestingly, the vast majority of positions were short, but given the aforementioned focus on two currencies, this is probably a coincidence.

The second trader was much closer to the loss limits than the first, but the margin was still there. The trader maintained a commendable Risk-Reward Ratio (RRR) of 1.5, coupled with a win rate of 64.71%. Similar to the first case, achieving substantial profit did not require an extensive number of trades. In total, 17 trades were executed with a cumulative size of 87 lots, averaging approximately 5.1 lots per trade. For the size of the account, this is a fairly conservative approach.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/en\/scaling-plan?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=banner&amp;utm_campaign=successfultraders \" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-546367 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_3-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"130\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_3-1.png 800w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_3-1-300x49.png 300w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_3-1-768x125.png 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_3-1-705x115.png 705w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_3-1-24x4.png 24w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_3-1-36x6.png 36w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_3-1-48x8.png 48w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Both traders are proof that in the pursuit of big profits there is no need to take numerous trades and at the same time there is no need to open unnecessarily large positions, which ultimately represent a great mental burden for traders.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-600130\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Objectives-02-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"809\" height=\"997\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Objectives-02-1.png 809w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Objectives-02-1-243x300.png 243w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Objectives-02-1-768x946.png 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Objectives-02-1-572x705.png 572w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 809px) 100vw, 809px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>In contrast to the first trader in this scenario, it&#8217;s evident that this trader typically <a href=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/en\/how-can-you-improve-your-stop-loss-and-take-profit\/\">implemented a Stop Loss<\/a>, which is a positive indicator.
