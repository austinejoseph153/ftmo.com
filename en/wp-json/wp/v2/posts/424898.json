During my first year of trader, I got around $60.000 in just 2 weekends (when covid has just started). The market was very bullish for gold, and I thought we should just buy and buy no matter what lot size to put in. But I didn\u2019t know about selling it. Now when the price goes down around 300 pips my account is on MC because of my trading style in the older days (martingale) but lesson learnt.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How would you rate your experience with FTMO?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Before FTMO, I used one of the prop companies and I\u2019m not going to mention the name for privacy reason. And compared to FTMO, I am far more impressed with standard that FTMO rules. I guess it\u2019s quite straight forward since you just need to pay careful attention on the daily drawdown and maximum drawdown. Unlike the previous prop company that I joined, they calculated using the equity and I think it can be a bit biased. I would rate FTMO customer service 10\/10 because it is so easy for me to chat when there\u2019s some queries.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How did you eliminate the factor of luck in your trading?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Well first and foremost is you have to follow the trend. Keep on doing backtesting. And I did that for many years before being consistent. Feelings doesn\u2019t always work in trading as many traders keep their SL 100 pips and that\u2019s obviously massive. It should always be based on the right technical analysis. Before doing the real account, it is best to do the demo account.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-425011 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/Irene-trades-en-793x1030.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"793\" height=\"1030\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/Irene-trades-en-793x1030.png 793w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/Irene-trades-en-231x300.png 231w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/Irene-trades-en-768x997.png 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/Irene-trades-en-543x705.png 543w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/Irene-trades-en-18x24.png 18w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/Irene-trades-en-28x36.png 28w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/Irene-trades-en-37x48.png 37w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/Irene-trades-en.png 1001w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 793px) 100vw, 793px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Describe your best trade.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>My best trade is when I encountered more than 500 pips with gold because of following a very high time frame setup (weekly and daily).<\/p>\n<p><strong>How did you manage your emotions when you were in a losing trade?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This again will come down to psychology of risk management and also emotions. I\u2019ve had times when I am so eager to trade in the sideways and then once the SL hit, I trade again up to 2 times and that\u2019s totally a big mistake. I learn that sideways is a form of compression that price is moving towards the nearest support and resistance (outside the sideways) 90% of the time. Another example is when I tried to trade on a pair that I\u2019m not used to it which is BTC, the market was so sideways at that time and quite volatile that I ended up losing more that $1.000. However, I did a quick recovery with gold. With this I learnt that it is better to trade on a pair that you are used to it and avoid sideways market. To control my emotion, I will also close the chart for a while and then sleep or watch something. There is no point on regretting why your trade hits the SL. Just learn from it as there will be a better setup and each day might not be a profitable day<\/p>\n<p><strong>What would you like to say to other traders that are attempting to pass FTMO Challenge?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Don\u2019t give up and don\u2019t overtrade once you have hit the target. Don\u2019t be too aggressive even if you join the aggressive account as risk management is still the key to maintain your account. Do finish the challenge smoothly, I would recommend people to do swing trades. Swing trades are the best.<\/p>\n<h3>Trader Raul: <em>\u201cUnderstand your self-destructing behavior, encourage it and use it as fuel to achieve your goals.\u201d<\/em><\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-424923 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/Raul-259x300.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"259\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/Raul-259x300.jpeg 259w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/Raul-891x1030.jpeg 891w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/Raul-768x888.jpeg 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/Raul-610x705.jpeg 610w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/Raul-21x24.jpeg 21w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/Raul-31x36.jpeg 31w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/Raul-42x48.jpeg 42w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/Raul.jpeg 1107w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 259px) 100vw, 259px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>How did loss limits affect your trading style?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It didn&#8217;t necessarily affect it, it encouraged me to follow my risk management plan flawlessly.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What was the most difficult during your FTMO Challenge or Verification and how did you overcome it?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Having the patience to wait for the good setups due to the time limit of the challenge.

Yes, I follow it strictly.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What was the hardest obstacle on your trading journey?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Dealing with the &#8220;unknown&#8221;: Will I ever be consistent? If 90% of traders lose money, how am I going to be any different? I dealt with it by not identifying with every negative thought that emerged while, before and after trading. Doubt in the skill is what kills a trader, confidence in your own ability creates consistency. How do you create confidence? Firstly, to be confident in your trading approach, you need to be confident in all the areas of your life. Muscle building was my way to become more confident as well as studying philosophy, history and psychology to have more clear ideas and to know myself deeply. Lastly, traditional psychology teaches you to overcome or avoid your negative thoughts and emotions. By suppressing them you feed them your energy, potentially making it worse for you to perform. Instead, understand your self-destructing behavior, encourage it, and use it as fuel to achieve your goals. It can be your best ally if you use it wisely.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What is the number one piece of advice you would give to a new trader?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Focus on the process (present), not the money (past and future). You will definitely face your own demons while trading. Use it as fuel not as your enemy. If you are scared it&#8217;s a clear sign you are about to advance in your craft. If you are frustrated with your performance, use it to work smarter. Your own demons will try to lead you to instant gratification which causes overtrading, taking huge losses or not letting the winners run. If you focus on the present, you focus on the process. If you are overtrading or taking bad trades without risk management, you are living in the past or in the future (which creates frustration). The key is to train yourself to always stay present. When you are exercising your bicep, only center your attention there. Your mind will try to make you think about the homework you have tomorrow or your mistakes from the past. The thoughts will be there, but you don&#8217;t have to identify with them, keep the attention in the bicep. The same thing applies to washing the kitchen or cleaning the garden. You can do this in any &#8220;insignificant&#8221; activity you do during your day. This training will make you a consistent trader if you really want it.<\/p>\n<p>__________<\/p>\n<div class=\"entry-content\">\n<div class=\"entry-content\">\n<p><em>Editorial note<\/em>:\u00a0<em>All responses are 100% organic and received from our new FTMO Traders during the contract signing process.
