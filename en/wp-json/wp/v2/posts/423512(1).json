If I did start to feel stressed or emotional, I would manage this by going for a walk or to the gym to have a break from the trading view, when feeling more relaxed you are then able to go back and assess what went wrong which enables you to learn from your mistakes.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How did the Loss limits affect your trading style?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I always stay under 3%, the majority of the time I trade at 1%, and I am always happy with my profit. The key is to not get greedy, as this can damage or ruin your account and lead to a large loss. It is rare I go to 3% as I believe this can be a high risk; the rare exception being, if I can clearly see the analysis 100% at high size with low SL or at low size with high SL.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Do you have a trading plan in place, and do you follow it strictly?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Yes, I follow a trading plan and I have also created my own set of golden rules, if I don\u2019t follow the rules or the plan then I wouldn\u2019t open a position as I know in myself this wouldn\u2019t be wise. When I have matched the plan to my own set of rules, I am then confident in opening a position.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-423543 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/Jonathan-trades-823x1030.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"823\" height=\"1030\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/Jonathan-trades-823x1030.png 823w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/Jonathan-trades-240x300.png 240w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/Jonathan-trades-768x961.png 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/Jonathan-trades-564x705.png 564w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/Jonathan-trades-19x24.png 19w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/Jonathan-trades-29x36.png 29w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/Jonathan-trades-38x48.png 38w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/Jonathan-trades.png 912w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 823px) 100vw, 823px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>How would you rate your experience with FTMO?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>On a scale of 1 to 10, I rate FTMO a 10! I truly believe it is an amazing experience, the first time I joined I enjoyed the new challenge in learning the games rules and limits. After I had got to grips with everything and had learnt from the game\u2019s rules, I was then able to create my own set of rules which I feel works well for me.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What was the hardest obstacle on your trading journey?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The hardest for me was staying patient during slow days and trying to remember that profit will come, I found it frustrating when I realized I had just missed the perfect entry point and knowing I had to persevere and wait until the suitable time opened up.<\/p>\n<p><strong>One piece of advice for people starting the FTMO Challenge now.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>My advice would be to follow FTMO rules and set up your own risk management, create a plan that works for you including golden rules you will stick to such as how you will manage your frustrations and fears, your limits in a bid to ensure you don\u2019t get greedy. Remember, the way to be successful is to not rush and never ever give up!<\/p>\n<h3>Trader Amir: <em>\u201cTake care of your risk management, it is incredibly important.\u201d<\/em><\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-423523 size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/Amir-169x300.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"169\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/Amir-169x300.jpeg 169w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/Amir-579x1030.jpeg 579w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/Amir-768x1365.jpeg 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/Amir-864x1536.jpeg 864w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/Amir-1152x2048.jpeg 1152w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/Amir-844x1500.jpeg 844w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/Amir-397x705.jpeg 397w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/Amir-14x24.jpeg 14w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/Amir-20x36.jpeg 20w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/Amir-27x48.jpeg 27w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/Amir-scaled.jpeg 1440w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 169px) 100vw, 169px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>What was easier than expected during the FTMO Challenge or Verification?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This is not my first time, so I knew what to expect. Self-confidence was better this time, but the first trades were a little scary, but eventually it became completely normal. Phase 2 went very well, considering the win rate and things like that. The challenge itself went very well, but you quickly notice that it is very much about discipline and self-confidence, you have to trust yourself, and make good choices.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Do you plan to take another FTMO Challenge to manage even bigger capital?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>For now, I will stick to just one account. I will have to master it first and think about it. But it sounds like something I&#8217;ll be considering in the future.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Describe your best trade.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I was minus in phase 1. Around 2 &#8211; 3 000.

We all need good trading plan, and we all need good risk management plan. Its key for me<\/p>\n<p><strong>Do you have a trading plan in place, and do you follow it strictly?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Of Course! Trading plan with risk management is key for success. I prefer trading with 0.5%, max 0.7 % per one position. This is because if I have 3 SL for one day, I am done. But with this risk when I hit 3rd time SL I loose just max 2% and with next TP with RR 1:5 or 1:6 and more I cover my loss and then I am in profit. You just need good strategy with big RRR.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Do you plan to take another FTMO Challenge to manage even bigger capital?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Yes. Probably 100 000 or 200 000.
