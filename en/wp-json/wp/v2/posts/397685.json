It would be nice to pass in the 10 days, but it is comforting to know you have longer than 10 days and that takes the pressure off taking unnecessary risks.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How does your risk management plan look like?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>My risk management plan is to risk no more than 1% per trade. If the market was moving in my favor, I would move my stop loss to break even and my initial trade becomes risk-free. I then look to add more positions as the trade progresses and the market gives me opportunities.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What was more difficult than expected during your FTMO Challenge or Verification?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Having to stop myself from jumping in and out of trades was probably the only challenge mentally I had during this process. I had to remind myself that money management is important to be a successful FTMO trader and that you don\u2019t have to take every trade. With a good risk to reward strategy, you can pass with very few trades.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/evansm.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-397689\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/evansm.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1023\" height=\"965\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/evansm.jpg 1023w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/evansm-300x283.jpg 300w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/evansm-768x724.jpg 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/evansm-705x665.jpg 705w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1023px) 100vw, 1023px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>How did you manage your emotions when you were in a losing trade?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Stick to the plan.

You need to be patient and trust in your trading plan. Some days will be good, and some will be bad. But trust the process and stay in profit. The worst that could happen is you don\u2019t meet the profit target and have to take another free retry. Accepting the risks of failing ultimately frees you to trade openly without holding back.<\/p>\n<h3>Trader Luz &#8211; <em>&#8220;It&#8217;s all probability and my job is just to analyze and execute.&#8221;<\/em><\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/luzp.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-397692 size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/luzp-300x228.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"228\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/luzp-300x228.jpg 300w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/luzp-768x583.jpg 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/luzp-705x535.jpg 705w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/luzp.jpg 784w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>How does your risk management plan look like?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I look for only high probability trades over 80 % and I use 1% to 1.5% per trade.

When learning to trade a few years ago I went through all the common mistakes like over leveraging and\/or blowing accounts when trades go against you from not having stops. Trading now is much more disciplined because of it. I think you need to experience the downfalls to know how to avoid certain mistakes in the future. With this being said.. failing hurts and takes time to recover.. but with it comes experience.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Where have you learnt about FTMO?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve watched a lot of your videos on youtube now which I find really interesting. Keep them coming!!<\/p>\n<p><strong>What do you think is the most important characteristic\/attribute to become a profitable trader?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Managing risk every time! I spent 5 months modeling different scenarios in Excel and incorporating some of the worst market fluctuations that have historically occurred. (Like T-May Brexit talks or the Swiss crash for example). Modeling these in preparation for my FTMO challenge meant I was able to never risk going above my equity limitation.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/glennm.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-397727\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/glennm.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1026\" height=\"969\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/glennm.jpg 1026w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/glennm-300x283.jpg 300w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/glennm-768x725.jpg 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/glennm-705x666.jpg 705w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1026px) 100vw, 1026px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>What was easier than expected during the FTMO Challenge or Verification?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>To be honest.. It was as expected. as mentioned above I spent 5 months modelling various Lot size, Stop losses, qty of active trades etc.. This then ensured that no matter what the market threw at me.. I could trade my way to success.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How did you eliminate the factor of luck in your trading?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>There was no luck. Some of my strategies don&#8217;t get it right every time. But it&#8217;s how you manage your trades when the market turns against you. For me, I look to close out partial positions in losing trades. Other times, I set SL and TPs based on S&amp;R. Similar to losing trades, I take partial profits and reset my SL to break even.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What is the number one advice you would give to a new trader?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Concentrate on one currency pair. then use a small amount of capital to trade with. Not so small that you trade carelessly, and not so big that you put yourself in financial harm.. but enough that makes you care. Then.. risk 3% max per trade.<\/p>\n<h3>Trader Juan &#8211; <em>&#8220;I believe passing this evaluation has given me confidence in myself and my skillset.&#8221;<\/em><\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/juanp-scaled.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-397707\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/juanp-300x219.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"219\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/juanp-300x219.jpg 300w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/juanp-1030x753.jpg 1030w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/juanp-768x562.jpg 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/juanp-1536x1124.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/juanp-2048x1498.jpg 2048w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/juanp-1500x1097.jpg 1500w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/juanp-705x516.jpg 705w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>How does passing the Challenge and Verification changed your life?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I think the monetary potential aside, I believe passing this evaluation has given me confidence in myself and my skillset.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What do you think is the key for long term success in trading?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I know the key for long-term success is to focus on risk instead of potential gain.
