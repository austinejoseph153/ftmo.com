So the profit target and time limit actually affected my trading style. I trade bigger time frame setups, so it wasn&#8217;t easy to get it done in only 1 month.<\/p>\n<p>Therefore, I realized I need to carefully cherry-pick the best setup and execute it with a higher risk than usual. However, In the funded account where there is no time limit or profit target, I will go back to very conservative risk management, where I only risk 0.5-1% and where I can also skip some days with no setups and low volatility.<\/p>\n<p>The primary goal is never to reach any loss limit secondary goal is to profit over time slowly.<\/p>\n<p>Describe your best trade.<\/p>\n<p>Best trade or trades came from a big time frame like daily or even monthly and started working out almost immediately. This, for example, worked out for me multiple times in the DAX. The best trade was in the DAX. It was a short daily setup. I opened it right at the London opening, and it went down a couple of percent right away, basically not ever going into minus.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What was the hardest obstacle on your trading journey?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Phase 2 was the hardest obstacle. It was here where I failed multiple times. This happened because, in phase 1, where there is a 10% profit to achieve in only 1 month, I cherry-picked my set up very carefully and only started the challenge with a perfect setup since I knew how hard it would be.<\/p>\n<p>However, in phase 2, I didn&#8217;t wait because I thought I only need 5%, and I have a 10% downside and 2 months.<\/p>\n<p>Overall I was expecting it to be way easier, which was a foolish mistake since trading is never easy.<\/p>\n<p>I could have saved money by only starting phase 2 with a top setup and wait until this setup then occurs.<\/p>\n<p>I often traded instruments like forex during the challenge, which I usually don&#8217;t trade just because I thought there is a setup here, and I have a time limit. I realized later that my trading style shouldn&#8217;t deviate from other instruments.<\/p>\n<p>Sticking only to DAX and don&#8217;t look at anything else also helped me pass phase 2. Psychological phase 2 is also harder because you get that feeling of you are almost at the finish line, and once you start losing, that is slipping away from you.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How would you rate your experience with FTMO?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It was a good experience overall. It makes you more disciplined and pushes you to your boundary, which is difficult but makes you mentally stronger after you have passed it eventually.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What was easier than expected during the FTMO Challenge or Verification?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Nothing really, trading is one of the hardest things you can do in your life, and it will always be that way, despite how many years of experience you have and what other circumstances surround you.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What is the number one advice you would give to a new trader?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Cherry-pick your first trade very carefully. Only start phase 1 and phase 2 when the best setup you get occurs exactly the instrument you want.<\/p>\n<p>Please don&#8217;t rush the process as I did, especially in the transition to phase 2. Another piece of advice is to cut back on your ambitions with FTMO.<\/p>\n<p>My ambitions were too high in hindsight. My goal was to pass FTMO within 6 months (due to work-related reasons), which I eventually did. However, if my goal was more modest (like just ending a challenge in profit), I could have saved money because you can always take it slow and step by step that way, by only ending the process with a little bit of profit and then try the whole process again for free of course.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/jonasm.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-398779\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/jonasm.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"719\" height=\"706\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/jonasm.jpg 719w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/jonasm-300x295.jpg 300w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/jonasm-80x80.jpg 80w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/jonasm-36x36.jpg 36w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/jonasm-705x692.jpg 705w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 719px) 100vw, 719px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Trader Anton &#8211; <em>&#8220;Don\u2019t be greedy.
