It was a short position on GBP\/AUD for 138 pips. What made this trade so amazing was that it was almost a 1:10 Risk\/Reward trade which is way higher than my usual 1:2.5 \u2013 3 trades. Before placing the trade I was down almost 5% on the account (halfway to losing the account with the Maximum Drawdown being 10%). But after winning this trade I made back the 4.5% of drawdown and made over 5% in profit, giving me a total of 9.67% &amp; just enough to pass the Verification stage. This trade will always be significant to me because it is a perfect result of what can happen when you never give up. Keep your psychology in order &amp; see your goals through to the very end.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>What do you think is the key for long-term success in trading?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Strong psychology &amp; being disciplined in your risk management.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>What was more difficult than expected during your FTMO Challenge or Verification?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The psychological effect of having a smaller profit goal during the Verification stage (5%) compared to the Challenge stage (10%). I feel as though it can cause a bit of overconfidence to set in for the typical trader and gives the challenge of learning to combat that overconfidence with reassessing your psychology to remain neutral in your trading.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-539656\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/Tyree-trades.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"912\" height=\"1223\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/Tyree-trades.png 912w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/Tyree-trades-224x300.png 224w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/Tyree-trades-768x1030.png 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/Tyree-trades-526x705.png 526w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/Tyree-trades-18x24.png 18w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/Tyree-trades-27x36.png 27w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/Tyree-trades-36x48.png 36w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 912px) 100vw, 912px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><b>Has your psychology ever affected your trading plan?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes, but that is where discipline kicks in.
