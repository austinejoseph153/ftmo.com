What does this new change mean for traders?<\/p>\n<p>Simply put, for many traders, some of the stress they had when trading with a fixed trading period will be removed. Making money in Forex is generally not easy and achieving a 10% return in one month can already be a chore for many traders. In an open-ended trading period, there is no need to rush into trades, it is much easier to think about position sizes, wait for the right time to enter, and then let the trades do their work.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/trader.ftmo.com\/start-challenge?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=banner&amp;utm_campaign=nolimits\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-546404 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_1-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"130\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_1-1.png 800w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_1-1-300x49.png 300w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_1-1-768x125.png 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_1-1-705x115.png 705w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_1-1-24x4.png 24w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_1-1-36x6.png 36w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_1-1-48x8.png 48w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Beware of swaps!<\/h2>\n<p>Forex trading is particularly suitable for intraday and short-term traders due to the use of leverage <a href=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/en\/what-is-a-swap-and-for-whom-is-it-important\/\">and the existence of swaps<\/a>, and the classic &#8220;buy and hold&#8221; strategy does not work well for trading leveraged products. In fact, a trader holding one instrument for several days can lose several percent of his potential profit <a href=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/en\/what-is-a-swap-and-for-whom-is-it-important\/\">just due to negative swaps<\/a>. When a position is in a loss, it is compounded by swaps. In this situation, it is necessary to keep in mind that despite the set Stop Losses, such a long-term position, in which swaps start to play an important role, may still result in a bigger loss than the trader planned. In the worst case scenario, by failing to meet one of the loss limits (the Maximum Loss or the Maximum Daily Loss).<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/trader.ftmo.com\/start-challenge?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=banner&amp;utm_campaign=nolimits\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-546397 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_2-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"130\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_2-1.png 800w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_2-1-300x49.png 300w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_2-1-768x125.png 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_2-1-705x115.png 705w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_2-1-24x4.png 24w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_2-1-36x6.png 36w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_2-1-48x8.png 48w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>If you trade and accidentally leave your account inactive for a few weeks, we will contact you to make sure the account is not sitting unused on our server, taking up space.
