But how can we identify a strong or weak currency?<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Currency pair trading is specific in that within one investment instrument, we have two currencies, where the value of one currency is quoted against the value of the other currency. For example, the currency pair<a href=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/en\/usdjpy-clash-of-two-cultures-east-and-west\/\"> USDJPY<\/a> represents the value of the US Dollar in Japanese Yen. The EURUSD pair in turn represents the value of the Euro in US Dollars.<\/p>\n<h2>Two instruments in one<\/h2>\n<p>By opening one position, we speculate on the strengthening of one currency and\/or the weakening of the other. When we speculate on the strengthening of one currency, it does not necessarily mean that the other one must depreciate. In fact, when we open a long position in, for example, the EURUSD pair, it may mean that we are speculating on the Euro strengthening, but the Dollar may not be weakening relative to other currencies. Or we may speculate on the Dollar weakening in this position, but that does not necessarily mean that the Euro will strengthen against other currencies.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/academy.ftmo.com\/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=banner&amp;utm_campaign=currencystrenght\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-610336 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/New-to-trading-banner-EN.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"950\" height=\"130\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/New-to-trading-banner-EN.jpg 950w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/New-to-trading-banner-EN-300x41.jpg 300w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/New-to-trading-banner-EN-768x105.jpg 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/New-to-trading-banner-EN-705x96.jpg 705w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 950px) 100vw, 950px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>The strengthening or weakening of an individual currency depends on many factors, but we cannot clearly read the strength or weakness of a currency (for example, the Euro in the EURUSD pair) from one currency pair. It is true that currently, investors can determine the strength of individual currencies by using currency indices, which are available for all major currencies. However, these indices are not available in the trading platforms of mainstream brokers. One way to do this, then, may be to use <a href=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/en\/ctrader-indicators\/\">so-called heatmaps<\/a>. These graphically show the relative strength of individual currencies against each other, or the relative performance of individual pairs on different time frames.<\/p>\n<h2>How to find a strong and weak currency?<\/h2>\n<p>Another way may be to compare several currency pairs in which a particular currency occurs and determine its current strength or weakness accordingly. This will allow us to pick out currencies (and it doesn&#8217;t have to be just the so called &#8220;major&#8221; currencies) that have the potential to rise and combined with simple <a href=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/en\/how-to-trade-smart-money-concepts-smc\/\">price action<\/a>, this can help us in our decision making.<\/p>\n<p>A strong currency that strengthens against most currencies in the market has the potential to grow further, while a weak currency may tend to weaken more significantly. Or conversely, if a strong currency has had a longer uptrend relative to most other currencies, this may be a sign of overvaluation, and we can look for signals indicating a trend reversal. If we can find one potentially strong and one potentially weak currency, this may be an interesting investment opportunity.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/trader.ftmo.com\/start-challenge?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=banner&amp;utm_campaign=currencystrenght\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-608275 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/Get-100-000-banner-EN.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"950\" height=\"130\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/Get-100-000-banner-EN.jpg 950w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/Get-100-000-banner-EN-300x41.jpg 300w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/Get-100-000-banner-EN-768x105.jpg 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/Get-100-000-banner-EN-705x96.jpg 705w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 950px) 100vw, 950px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>In the picture below, we have several currency pairs whose common currency is the Euro. These are the Euro pairs with all the major currencies on the four-hour (H4) charts, and we have added the EURCZK pair for reference. The advantage in this case is the fact that the Euro is the base currency in all cases (it comes first in the pair), so it is clear when the Euro is rising and when it is weakening compared to the other currencies. On the CHF and JPY pairs the EUR is in a fairly strong trend, on the USD pair it looks like an end to this strong trend and a possible reversal. On the CAD pairs, it is more the start of a stronger trend that could last for a longer period of time and the EUR is in a similar position on the pair with NZD (and possibly AUD), where a reversal of the downtrend could occur.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-610229 size-full\" title=\"EUR Pairs\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/EUR-Pairs.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1916\" height=\"857\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/EUR-Pairs.png 1916w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/EUR-Pairs-300x134.png 300w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/EUR-Pairs-1030x461.png 1030w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/EUR-Pairs-768x344.png 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/EUR-Pairs-1536x687.png 1536w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/EUR-Pairs-1500x671.png 1500w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/EUR-Pairs-705x315.png 705w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1916px) 100vw, 1916px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Looking at the USD pairs, we can see that in most cases (compared to EUR, GBP, AUD, NZD and CAD) there is a trend reversal in favour of the US currency. On the pairs in the upper half of the figure, we have to remember that the USD is the <a href=\"https:\/\/academy.ftmo.com\/lesson\/what-is-traded-in-forex-currencies-and-correlations\/\">quote currency<\/a> in these cases (it is the second in the currency pair), so a move downwards means it is strengthening against the other currency in the pair. On the pairs with CHF and JPY, the USD is then in consolidation. From these two examples, the USD appears to be a strong currency and the NZD and AUD appear to be weak currencies.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-610237 size-full\" title=\"USD Pairs\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/USD-Pairs.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1917\" height=\"853\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/USD-Pairs.png 1917w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/USD-Pairs-300x133.png 300w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/USD-Pairs-1030x458.png 1030w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/USD-Pairs-768x342.png 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/USD-Pairs-1536x683.png 1536w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/USD-Pairs-1500x667.png 1500w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/USD-Pairs-705x314.png 705w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1917px) 100vw, 1917px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Looking at the AUD and NZD currency pairs, we can see quite clearly that both currencies are poised to weaken relative to most other currency pairs.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-610245 size-full\" title=\"NZD Pairs\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/NZD-Pairs.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1914\" height=\"850\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/NZD-Pairs.png 1914w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/NZD-Pairs-300x133.png 300w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/NZD-Pairs-1030x457.png 1030w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/NZD-Pairs-768x341.png 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/NZD-Pairs-1536x682.png 1536w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/NZD-Pairs-1500x666.png 1500w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/NZD-Pairs-705x313.png 705w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1914px) 100vw, 1914px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>If the trend reversal in these pairs is confirmed, speculating on a strong currency, in this case the USD, rising and a weak currency (AUD or NZD) weakening could be an interesting opportunity.
