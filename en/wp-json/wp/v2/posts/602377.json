Excellent experience.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How did you manage your emotions when you were in a losing trade?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Whenever I have a losing trade, I step away from trading for a moment and meditate. It brings me back to a calm, rational and logical mind. I visualize my goals and re-calibrate myself. I then step back to trading and before placing another trade, I do a few things including assessing why the losing trade happened, what I did wrong and what I could have done right. I write in my trading journal everything that I did, including my emotions during placing the trade. I tell myself that a losing trade is part of the game and that a winning trade may just be around the corner which will make up for the loss and some more.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What do you think is the key for long term success in trading?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Discipline, dedication, devotion, excellent trading skills, self-worth, hyper focus, ambition, psychology, self-control, excellent risk and money management, fearlessness, courage, and a love for trading. Always have a trading plan and follow only the plan. Be patient and wait for the perfect set-up. If there are no set ups available, wait and do not trade, a set up will eventually become available to you. Keep the losses small and let the profits ride using a Trailing Stop Loss.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-602413\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/Deeptishrao-trades.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"913\" height=\"1267\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/Deeptishrao-trades.png 913w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/Deeptishrao-trades-216x300.png 216w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/Deeptishrao-trades-742x1030.png 742w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/Deeptishrao-trades-768x1066.png 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/Deeptishrao-trades-508x705.png 508w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 913px) 100vw, 913px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Do you plan to take another FTMO Challenge to manage even bigger capital?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Yes.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How has passing the FTMO Challenge and Verification changed your life?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I feel I am closer to achieving my wildest dreams.

There is never certainty about the outcome of an open trade, but it is possible to only operate trades with high probability. A good technique guarantees you to operate in the best way possible, regardless of whether the result will be a gain or a loss.
