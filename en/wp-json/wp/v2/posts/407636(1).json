The simple fact that a strategy has been profitable in the past is a factor that contributes to the trader\u2019s confidence. How often do traders interfere with their trading plan because they are on a losing streak? By having objective data of past performance, you can assess whether a drawdown (which every strategy has) is within your tolerance.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a result, a trader is less inclined to interfere with the<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ir<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> trading plan.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Past performance is not necessarily an indicator of future results<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">,<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> but <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">knowing that a strategy made money in the past is more reassuring than using the one that didn\u2019t.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>More time for Analysis<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you don\u2019t have to spend countless hours in front of the screen, you can invest your time in more meaningful things, such as developing more trading models, evaluat<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ing<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> your current trading models and backtest<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is said that 80% of success in trading is in <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">preparation.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Multitask &amp; Diversify<\/h2>\n<p>Humans are bad at multitasking. A single human has a limited amount of attention and consequently, it is not possible to manage 1,000 charts and 10,000 trades at the same time. Furthermore, the more active you are in trading the higher the risk of making errors when trading.<\/p>\n<p>As an Algo-Trader you are not limited by this as the trading robots do the work for you. You can trade any symbol, on any timeframe, using any strategy and your only job as an algo-trader is to evaluate the results, not do the trading.<\/p>\n<p>Also, having more strategies on multiple assets and different timeframes diversifies your portfolio. Having a diversified portfolio adds more consistency to your trading.<\/p>\n<h2>Python vs MQL<\/h2>\n<p>Python is a universal programming language that can be deployed on any platform whereas MQL4\/5 and is bound within the MetaTrader ecosystem.<\/p>\n<p>The advantage of MQL4\/5 is that it comes with ready-made tools to quickly code and deploy trading robots on your trading platform. This makes it easy for beginners to create trading robots as MQL4 and MQL5 have been specifically designed to develop trading related codes. Furthermore, the MetaTrader platform comes with a built-in backtester where you can quickly run a simulation of your trading strategy on historical data to evaluate its performance.<\/p>\n<p>On the other hand, <strong>Python<\/strong> provides more flexibility and freedom. <strong>Python<\/strong> offers a wide range of<strong> OpenSource Libraries<\/strong> used for Data Science, Machine Learning. Backtesting and many more. Furthermore, it is also possible to connect your Python scripts to almost all modern trading platforms (including MetaTrader4 and MetaTrader5).<\/p>\n<p>Generally, it is recommended to start with the <a href=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/en\/mql4\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">MQL4 programming<\/a> language as it is very easy. Over time, if you feel limited by the MQL language, then you might consider adding Python as another programming language.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/docs.mql4.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https:\/\/docs.mql4.com\/<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In this article, we will cover the advantages of using automated trading robots for Algorithmic Traders, advise on how to begin if you are a beginner and discuss common programming languages such as Python, MQL4 and MQL5 and which one you should use.
