I&#8217;ve watched myself sabotaging multiple times because I was giving up mentally that I&#8217;m unable to get to the profit target when I was on a negative P&amp;L because I tried to do it as fast as I could, accepting every setup instead of analyzing it and reading the full story and the context behind each confirmation rule.<\/p>\n<p>In order to overcome this, I had to change the way I was thinking, to think bigger, to accept more from life and to stop playing it safe.<\/p>\n<p>I had to work every day with my thoughts and with my mind in order to break this zone of mediocrity.<\/p>\n<p>After working on this, I didn&#8217;t have any fear of losing money, I had control of what I was thinking and I was able to spot better trading setups in the market in order to get back to the profit target.<\/p>\n<h3>Trader Sheena reflects on her journey<\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-394379\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/sheenap-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/sheenap-300x300.jpg 300w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/sheenap-80x80.jpg 80w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/sheenap-36x36.jpg 36w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/sheenap-180x180.jpg 180w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/sheenap.jpg 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>How did you eliminate the factor of luck in your trading?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I made a plan of keeping a daily goal and sticking to 1-3 instruments.

FTMO is truly worth the many numbers of tries because you could get 10x more of your investment back in the first withdrawal if you take this seriously.

Entry at the Higher Low and take profit set at the new record high.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What inspires you to pursue trading?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>My family, my wife and my one-year-old baby boy. The ability to own your time. The personal development that it requires. I&#8217;m inspired by the growth, the journey and the dedication it takes to become a successful trader. Last but not least I&#8217;m inspired by my mentors and the successful traders that I personally know.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-394391\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/shamirm.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"919\" height=\"765\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/shamirm.jpg 919w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/shamirm-300x250.jpg 300w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/shamirm-768x639.jpg 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/shamirm-705x587.jpg 705w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 919px) 100vw, 919px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>What was the most difficult during your Challenge or Verification and how did you overcome it?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not used to trading with a time limit so for me that was probably the most difficult to get over on a mindset level. Knowing I had 30 days to reach my profit target while trying to stay disciplined enough to avoid the daily losses. The type of trader I am, I usually will take 1-3 trades a week or two may be depending on the set up I have.<\/p>\n<p>But this forced me to be a little more active while still staying disciplined and patient as possible. It was a great experience and definitely built my confidence. Once I settled in I realized I didn&#8217;t have to change my trading style per se, I just needed to overcome the mindset of feeling like I was going to run out of time. And stick to the trading plan.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What do you think is the key for long term success in trading?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Patience + Discipline = Consistency. The \u201cahaa\u201d moment comes when you realize that mindset is more important than technicals.<\/p>\n<p>Anyone can learn technicals, anyone can learn patterns and how to identify trends. But not just anyone is going to take the trade, and manage the trade properly after. It&#8217;s really a skill you must develop from the inside out. Understanding what the market is currently doing is one thing but understand yourself as a trader is a key.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Do you have a trading plan in place, and do you follow it strictly?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Market structure, candlesticks and price action. My trading plan is to trade what I see, not what I think. Stay patient, less is always more and don&#8217;t force anything.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What would you like to say to other traders that are attempting the Challenge?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Do it! It truly challenges you as a trader. It will help you set and follow your own trading goals and objectives. If you want to pass the Challenge you must follow a plan. This Challenge will be just another accomplishment in your trading journey. Don&#8217;t rush it, 30 days might not seem like a lot of time when you are rushing to make a profit target, but if you just be patient, stay disciplined and let the trades come to you, you will realize that 30 days is more than you need.<\/p>\n<h3>How trader Joseph managed his emotions while trading?<\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-394396\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/josephp-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/josephp-225x300.jpg 225w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/josephp-773x1030.jpg 773w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/josephp-768x1024.jpg 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/josephp-529x705.jpg 529w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/josephp.jpg 810w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>What do you think is the key for long term success in trading?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The key to long term success in trading is to be disciplined, only disciplined traders last longer in the market, most times greed is what makes most retail traders fail in the forex market.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How did you manage your emotions when you were in a losing trade?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I managed my emotions very well because I worked on myself in that aspect before taking the tests, too emotional attachment during trades affects one&#8217;s trades too, so I was very disciplined with my strategy and I trusted the strategy so much, even when I made losses, I encouraged myself to do more analysis to find out where it all went wrong and had to re-strategise<\/p>\n<p><strong>Do you plan to take another FTMO Challenge to manage even bigger capital?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Yes, my goal is to manager bigger capitals, but due to some financial constraint, I started with the least Challenge I could afford.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-394400 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/josephm.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"924\" height=\"765\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/josephm.jpg 924w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/josephm-300x248.jpg 300w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/josephm-768x636.jpg 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/josephm-705x584.jpg 705w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 924px) 100vw, 924px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Describe your best trade.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Honestly, during the trading days, I&#8217;ve had so many best trades as well as worse trades, but the best trades I made me happy, I felt like heavy was in my house at that moment.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How did Maximum loss limits affect your trading style?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It honestly did affect my trading style as I was very aware of the drawdown, and I don&#8217;t want to fail the Challenge at the first trial, so I had to stick to the lot sizes that suited that Challenge, I also had to switch to the trading style that suits the policy.<\/p>\n<p><strong>One piece of advice for people starting the Challenge now.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Well a simple piece of advice to those starting the Challenge is to be first disciplined if anyone wants to last in the forex market, such a person has to be disciplined, secondly, trust your strategy, even if sometimes it may not work out for you, just trust it more.<\/p>\n<h3>Trader Alexis from the United States<\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-394404\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/alexisp-280x300.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"280\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/alexisp-280x300.jpeg 280w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/alexisp-962x1030.jpeg 962w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/alexisp-768x822.jpeg 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/alexisp-1434x1536.jpeg 1434w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/alexisp-1912x2048.jpeg 1912w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/alexisp-1401x1500.jpeg 1401w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/alexisp-658x705.jpeg 658w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 280px) 100vw, 280px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>How does your risk management plan look like?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Before I enter a trade, I calculate how many pips I&#8217;m willing to lose and the amount of money.
