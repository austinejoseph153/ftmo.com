Once I was able to identify the opportunity (US100), I got in and loaded the trade up, and exited a few minutes later because the market did a double tap (1:1.5 RRR). Once the market created a new high, I jumped in again and this time with bigger lots and a calculated Stop Loss, and managed to close on a 1:3.75 RRR. I closed it because I thought the market will dip due to it slowing down in momentum, but the moment the market gained momentum again I hopped in a third time and loaded up all the way until I hit the target (1:5.5 RRR)<\/p>\n<p><strong>How did you manage your emotions when you were in a losing trade?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I usually distracted myself with playing chess or continuing to read a book until the Stop Loss was hit. Monitoring the trade would not be a bad option but you are more prone to moving your Stop Loss if you do so.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How did you eliminate the factor of luck in your trading?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>By setting up a gameplan and knowing where and when to enter, and where the market trend is headed overall. I followed the basic price action to identify my opportunities luck-free.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-568686 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/Abdullah-trades.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"902\" height=\"1322\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/Abdullah-trades.png 902w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/Abdullah-trades-205x300.png 205w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/Abdullah-trades-703x1030.png 703w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/Abdullah-trades-768x1126.png 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/Abdullah-trades-481x705.png 481w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 902px) 100vw, 902px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>What does your risk management plan look like?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Risk per trade is around 0.3% to 0.9% and on rare occasions 1%. Once the trade gets profitable I would stack another one if the market continues in the desired action with the same amount of risk, but this time I would be at break-even if it fails because the first trade&#8217;s Stop Loss is now at breakeven and the new trade&#8217;s Stop Loss is with it.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What do you think is the key for long-term success in trading?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Discipline and self-control, identifying areas for improvement in your trades, and having an eye that can see the overall market direction ASAP. My first FTMO Challenge failed so hard because I did not realize how long my trades took (which was around two weeks for just one trade with 1% risk and 1:1.5 RRR and a TERRIBLE win rate). So basically, if you notice anything unusual in your trading style, I recommend you do a top-down analysis of everything regarding it.<\/p>\n<p><strong>One piece of advice for people starting an FTMO Challenge now.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Just know that if you work extremely hard at whatever you got going on and you stick to it, your whole life will change. It does not take a lot of effort to make it to the top but rather discipline is what it takes.

In the past, I began trading with less than 1% risk whenever I was in a drawdown. Also, my win rate was lower than 40% at the time. It caused my results to diminish slowly until the point of reaching Max Loss. Also, not overtrading was really hard, keeping your Max Daily Loss at a 2% maximum.
