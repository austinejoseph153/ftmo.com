I understand that psychology is an inevitable part of being a trader. As soon as I observed that, I calmed down to avoid falling into an uncontrolled trading state.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What do you think is the key for long term success in trading?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>There are many factors that influence a sustainable, long-term trader in the markets. However, in my opinion, the most important key that determines the success of a sustainable trader is capital management and a balanced mindset of the trader.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How would you rate your experience with FTMO?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>As a serious trader myself, I always considered this a dream job. I also searched for many companies that provide capital for traders. I highly appreciate the service FTMO provides to traders in general and to the Vietnamese market in particular. In Vietnam, not only me but many other traders in the community also put their full trust in FTMO. We hope FTMO continues to provide good service and build a clean, strong, and long-term trader community. With my experience up to now, I rate it 5 stars!<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-607676 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/Phong-trades.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"904\" height=\"1227\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/Phong-trades.png 904w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/Phong-trades-221x300.png 221w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/Phong-trades-759x1030.png 759w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/Phong-trades-768x1042.png 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/Phong-trades-519x705.png 519w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 904px) 100vw, 904px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>How did passing the FTMO Challenge and Verification change your life?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I focused on building a <a href=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/en\/we-pay-millions-in-payouts-to-our-ftmo-traders\/\">dream job with FTMO<\/a>, which had goals and an implementation strategy broken down into phases. The short-term goal is to stabilize trading with a reasonable, sustainable win rate. The medium-term goal is to increase the account size according to FTMO&#8217;s capital growth plan. Besides, I am also planning to travel around Vietnam, I can travel and work at the same time. A job with FTMO can help me achieve that dream!<\/p>\n<p><strong>How did the Maximum Loss limit affect your trading style?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>As mentioned above, the most important factor for me in trading is capital management. Depending on the size of the different accounts, I will have a maximum open status suitable for that account. If the account declines, I will adjust the open status for each trade according to the new account status. With a 200k USD account, I will typically open a maximum of 2 XAU lots at a time. And so, my trading method will be almost stable, not affected by losing trading positions.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/en\/scaling-plan?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=banner&amp;utm_campaign=tradersqa\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-546367 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_3-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"130\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_3-1.png 800w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_3-1-300x49.png 300w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_3-1-768x125.png 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_3-1-705x115.png 705w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_3-1-24x4.png 24w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_3-1-36x6.png 36w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_3-1-48x8.png 48w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>What is the number one advice you would give to a new trader?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It takes you 4 years to study at university, 2 to 3 years to learn a profession, then you can have the skills and knowledge to start applying for a job.

Accepting the risk or loss before you take the trade. This will prevent you from revenge trading or acting impulsively.

We feel that we need to be funded immediately, however by taking as much time as possible will allow you to only take high quality setups which will pay off in the long run. Also remember that if you enter into a drawdown, do not give up. Try to recover from drawdown. If you are able to achieve this, then you are guaranteed to be a profitable trader. This will help you to gain the necessary skills to always be profitable. Remember that if you just give up when you are in drawdown, then how would you expect to be profitable when your funded account goes into drawdown.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Forex trading is not for the faint of heart.
