I follow my rules and there is no need to count on luck.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What was the hardest obstacle on your trading journey?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The hardest obstacle on my trading journey was trading psychology, especially after the victory. For example, although the profit target of the verification stage is lower than the challenge one, I have passed the challenge almost 5 times with only 1 successful verification step. I&#8217;m pretty good at dealing with losses\/ fighting after a big loss day.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Screenshot-2021-07-26-at-9.59.03.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-410211 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Screenshot-2021-07-26-at-9.59.03.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"812\" height=\"788\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>What do you think is the most important characteristic\/attribute to become a profitable trader?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It is easy to say to stick with your rules. However, it is not as easy as it says. For me, being able to follow your rules and stick with your trading plan is the most important characteristic to become a profitable trader. Also, it takes time. If you can do it, you will be able to trade without emotions and take advantage of it.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How does your risk management plan look like?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll try to have at least 1:2 risk to reward ratio. For example, 30 pips stop loss against the 60 pips take profit. However, I don&#8217;t like to put SL and TP. I plan and visualize the SL and TP areas and prefer to manage my trades live according to what the market gives us.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What is the number one piece of advice you would give to a new trader?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Practice makes perfect.

I used to have so much FOMO on profits it would cause myself to do things that did not align with my risk management.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How did you manage your emotions when you were in a losing trade?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I managed my emotions by simply not looking at the dollar amount of drawdown I was in and strictly looking at that chart.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/EzekielM.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-410223 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/EzekielM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"812\" height=\"788\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>How has passing the FTMO Challenge and Verification changed your life?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Passing FTMO Challenge and Verification will completely change my life forever. As I am finally going to be able to be self-employed, I\u2019ll be able to work remotely and travel the world.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What was easier than expected during the FTMO Challenge or Verification?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I believe what was easier than expected was the Max drawdown. 10% to lose on an account isn\u2019t very hard when you are risking 1-3% a trade but if you manage risk correctly then you can still see a significant amount of gain on the account risking 0.5-0.75% a trade.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What would you like to say to other traders that are attempting the FTMO Challenge?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Good Luck. This challenge seems like a big deal. Because in some way it is. Stay calm and stick to your risk management. You will thank your future self.<\/p>\n<h3>Trader Moya &#8211; <em>&#8220;It\u2019s an unbelievable opportunity that I wish I discovered earlier!&#8221;<\/em><\/h3>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/MoyaP.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-410236 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/MoyaP.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"280\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>Where have you learnt about FTMO?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Through friends\/other traders who have recommended FTMO and have commented how brilliant the service is.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What do you think is the most important characteristic\/attribute to become a profitable trader?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Discipline! Patience, adaptability, resilience and mental toughness. I think the \u201ctechnical\u201d side of trading &#8211; analysis is only a small portion of the overall skill required. The majority of the skill is psychological. Once you overcome the psychological aspect and control your mindset, that is when profitability will become consistent.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What inspires you to pursue trading?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The freedom, flexibility and financial benefits mainly, that becoming a successful trader offers. I am inspired by trading as it does not discriminate, the opportunity is available to ANYONE no matter where you come from or what cards you have been dealt in life. In traditional employment, a person\u2019s upbringing\/educational background and qualifications can contribute massively to their chance of success\/making a good living. In trading none of this matters, it\u2019s an opportunity available to anyone who wants to pursue it.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/MoyaM.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-410241 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/MoyaM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"812\" height=\"788\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>How did you manage your emotions when you were in a losing trade?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Chilling out and not getting too worked up &#8211; taking a walk helps me. Meditation is amazing too. Also reminding myself that a losing trade is inevitable and not the end of the world and that there\u2019s always the next trade! If I\u2019m having a losing day I\u2019ll try to stay off my phone and not look at the market until the next day when I\u2019m feeling refreshed.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How did you eliminate the factor of luck in your trading?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Of course, luck plays some part in trading and it\u2019s great when it\u2019s on our side. However, we know that on the balance of probabilities, our trades cannot continuously win. To eliminate luck I think it\u2019s important to always stick to your strategy and plan, as your decisions will be based on a set amount of relative factors. Rather than a negative gambling approach, where success would be based more on luck.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What would you like to say to other traders that are attempting the FTMO Challenge?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Go for it! It\u2019s an unbelievable opportunity that I wish I discovered earlier! The feeling of passing is unbelievable especially if it has taken you a while to pass. Take your time and do not rush with eagerness, there are a minimum amount of trading days you need to complete anyway. Make sure to begin the challenge at a time that you can give it your full focus, as distractions can cost you. I\u2019d also keep the fact you\u2019re doing the challenge to yourself as pressure from others asking how it\u2019s going can cause unnecessary emotional pressure that could affect your performance.<\/p>\n<p>__________<\/p>\n<div class=\"entry-content\">\n<p><em>Editorial note<\/em>:\u00a0<em>All responses are 100% organic and received from our new FTMO Traders during the contract signing process.
