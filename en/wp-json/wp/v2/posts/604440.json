Given I stuck rigidly to my risk management plan, any losses that I made during this period were not \u2018painful\u2019. By sticking with the plan, I found any losses that I made were within the realm of what I was happy to lose. This kept my emotions in check.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What do you think is the key for long term success in trading?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Long term success in trading depends heavily on the management of risk. After trading for a number of years, I realised that managing the risk is what gives you longevity and preserves your capital. In my early trading days, I thought knowing which direction the prices were going was the most important thing. But I realised along the way that there are other aspects of the trade that are also very important. For example, getting better entry positions, managing the risk, knowing when to take profit.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-604511 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/Akoua-trades.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"908\" height=\"1230\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/Akoua-trades.png 908w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/Akoua-trades-221x300.png 221w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/Akoua-trades-760x1030.png 760w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/Akoua-trades-768x1040.png 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/Akoua-trades-520x705.png 520w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 908px) 100vw, 908px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Where have you learnt about FTMO?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I learnt about FTMO through word of mouth. A friend of mine thought it was an investment opportunity. When I researched the company, I realised it was actually a prop firm, and it looked like something I could do given I had some trading experience.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Has your psychology ever affected your trading plan?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In the early days, my psychology was all over the place. Although I never wanted to give up completely, it could be extremely painful and stressful. Then I read a really good book about the psychology of trading, I felt like that was the last piece of the puzzle. This book really underpinned the importance of my risk management system. It was then I realised that rigid risk management will eliminate negative trading psychology.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What would you like to say to other traders that are attempting the FTMO Challenge?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>If I was a trading teacher, I would probably teach risk management as the first module ha-ha\u2026. If you are serious about trading long term, this is probably the most important aspect of the challenge. Don\u2019t give up, manage your risk, take your time and be persistent.

No limits in terms of hours that you can put in and money that you can make at any hour of the day wherever you choose to be. If you want to make more money, however, you do not need to put in a lot more time every day, but give things more time as the longer and more consistent you are the more you will eventually make. While if you say give your job more time you may start out at one pay grade and 10\/15\/20 years later you may only be making 10-20% more than where you started, if even that much in many cases.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How has passing the <\/strong><strong>FTMO<\/strong> <strong>Challenge and Verification changed your life?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It has changed my life because with the income I will be able to generate I will be able to fully pursue my other entrepreneurial ambitions without having to lose time by committing to a job that would not have given me the opportunity the money FTMO can and will bring in.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Where have you learnt about FTMO?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I first learned about FTMO in 2018 when seeking out ways to have more capital or maybe work for a trading company online, but at that time it was not very popular, so I did not do further investigations into it.

No matter how good or even how bad you are, once you have good risk management and can keep an account alive, you will never go broke in trading. You will fund accounts less, do less challenges after even having a funded account already and have more peace of mind because the less you lose, the less you have to make to cover your losses as well. The gains are great, but if you can limit your losses, your account can only go up instead of down. With all of that said, still find a way to focus on trading to win and not trading to not lose.<\/p>\n<h3>Trader Brandon: \u201cContinue to work on yourself and master this skill, it will pay off in the long run.\u201d<\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-604490\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/Brandon-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/Brandon-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/Brandon-1030x772.jpg 1030w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/Brandon-768x576.jpg 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/Brandon-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/Brandon-2048x1536.jpg 2048w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/Brandon-1500x1125.jpg 1500w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/Brandon-705x529.jpg 705w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>What inspires you to pursue trading?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The ability to obtain financial freedom and work anywhere in the world, as well as a steady source of passive income that would enable me to make money even in my sleep.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What was the hardest obstacle on your trading journey?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The hardest obstacle on my journey was managing my emotions and being consistent. I knew my strategy worked perfectly, and my setups were valid, often my entries would have little to no drawdown, however due to the lack of self-control I had over my emotions, it would cause me to abandon my trading plan to trade out of emotion, leading to many losses and many blown accounts.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How did loss limits affect your trading style?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It forced me to take a conservative approach with my risk, as losing 5% in a day or 10% total would mean the breach of the loss limit, and the termination of the FTMO challenge. Therefore, I would try to only risk a maximum of 1-2% on every trade, as well as only taking high quality setups, reducing the total overall number of trades taken.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-604527\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/Brandon-trades.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"906\" height=\"1262\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/Brandon-trades.png 906w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/Brandon-trades-215x300.png 215w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/Brandon-trades-739x1030.png 739w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/Brandon-trades-768x1070.png 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/Brandon-trades-506x705.png 506w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 906px) 100vw, 906px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Has your psychology ever affected your trading plan?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Absolutely, psychology is arguably the most important aspect in trading as it can influence you to trade outside of your plan. Emotions such as fear and greed are severely detrimental to your trading plan, as it can cause you to overleverage or take low quality setups. I (and every other trader I&#8217;m sure) have taken unnecessary losses due to &#8220;revenge&#8221; trading, or FOMO (fear of missing out) on a trade. A great trader follows their trading plan strictly and does not allow emotion to sway them, no matter if they are in drawdown or floating in profits.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Where have you learnt about FTMO?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I learned about FTMO in 2019, around the time I started trading.
