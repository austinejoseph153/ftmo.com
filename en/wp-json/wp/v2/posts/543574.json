However, the reality is that traders like to share their ideas and thoughts, and they also like to hear other people\u2019s opinions. And we make it easy for them on the FTMO website.<\/span><\/em><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The trader is responsible for the strategy, money management and risk management settings, as well as the actual trades he executes, we don\u2019t need to argue about that. However, communication with other traders can also have a very positive effect on your results. You will get a different perspective on your own trades and, last but not least, while discussing charts with other people you can come up with new solutions that can help you achieve better results.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Communication with others can help everyone<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This doesn\u2019t just apply to new traders. Sharing thoughts and ideas can also have a positive effect on those of you who have already experienced something. Everyone can reach a point where trading becomes routine and you are no longer able to objectively perceive your shortcomings and possible mistakes. Interacting with other like-minded people can then help you to look at your trades from a different perspective and possibly eliminate some of the mistakes you don\u2019t notice yourself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-543677\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/OM-1030x579.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1030\" height=\"579\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/OM-1030x579.jpg 1030w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/OM-300x169.jpg 300w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/OM-768x432.jpg 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/OM-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/OM-2048x1152.jpg 2048w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/OM-1500x844.jpg 1500w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/OM-705x396.jpg 705w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/OM-24x13.jpg 24w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/OM-36x20.jpg 36w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/OM-48x27.jpg 48w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1030px) 100vw, 1030px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, in this case it is also true that too much of everything is harmful and too much reliance on other ideas is not the way to long-term profits. At best, you may come across someone who means well but whose strategy will not suit your style and approach to trading. In the\u00a0 worst case, you\u2019ll come across self-proclaimed gurus offering quick and easy guides to instant riches on social media, but that\u2019s usually a road to hell.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thus, while the ideas and results of other traders can act as an interesting inspiration, they cannot be taken as dogma, the only right solution. It\u2019s good to take the best from the community, but, as we have already mentioned, you are ultimately responsible for your own trades.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/trader.ftmo.com\/start-challenge\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-543692 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Blog-banner-Challenge-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"130\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Blog-banner-Challenge-1.jpg 800w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Blog-banner-Challenge-1-300x49.jpg 300w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Blog-banner-Challenge-1-768x125.jpg 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Blog-banner-Challenge-1-705x115.jpg 705w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Blog-banner-Challenge-1-24x4.jpg 24w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Blog-banner-Challenge-1-36x6.jpg 36w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Blog-banner-Challenge-1-48x8.jpg 48w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Trading ideas from FTMO<\/h2>\n<p>Sharing experiences and ideas between traders was at the heart of FTMO&#8217;s inception, and because of this we know how talking to like-minded people can help a trader achieve better results in the long term. A different perspective on market events or a different approach to money management and risk management can be the final piece to the puzzle that a trader is missing to be successful in the long term.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That\u2019s why we are introducing a new service called\u00a0<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/community.ftmo.com\/trading-ideas\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trading Ideas<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> which can be found in our Chat with Charts app. It was already possible to add chart images as part of chatting with other clients, however, Trading Ideas is aimed mainly at sharing trading ideas and charts in which traders can show their ideas for future entries using all the technical analysis tools available. Traders can also share their SL and TP level settings and show the details of their strategy or the reasons why they think this particular set up can lead to a potentially profitable trade.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-543554\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Trading-Ideas.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1915\" height=\"948\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Trading-Ideas.png 1915w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Trading-Ideas-300x149.png 300w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Trading-Ideas-1030x510.png 1030w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Trading-Ideas-768x380.png 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Trading-Ideas-1536x760.png 1536w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Trading-Ideas-1500x743.png 1500w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Trading-Ideas-705x349.png 705w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Trading-Ideas-24x12.png 24w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Trading-Ideas-36x18.png 36w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Trading-Ideas-48x24.png 48w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1915px) 100vw, 1915px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Trading Ideas app is an extension of Chat with Charts that brings several improvements. Adding and editing new trading ideas is simple and intuitive and takes a minimum amount of time. The charts are available in the TradingView format, so those who have experience with this service know how easy it is to use it. Of course, you can sort symbols and search by the name of each symbol or investment instrument. The tags you use when you create a new idea also simplify the search and navigation of trading ideas. Another improvement is the ability to filter the trading ideas by the date the idea was created, or you can display posts that have received the most amount of positive reviews from other traders or have the most comments.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The purpose of Trading Ideas is not to show that we are better than others. Trading is not a competition to see who can make more profits with one trade, but rather a competition for long-term consistency. It\u2019s not a sprint, it\u2019s a long run. Sharing your trading ideas and observing thoughts and approaches of others can help you gain a different perspective and insight into trading, which can help you perform better in the long run. We hope that you enjoy our new app and find inspiration to help you become a successful trader.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Trading is perceived by many people as an individual business, where the trader is responsible only for his own strategy and trades, and may not be interested in the opinions of others.
