I started trading on the second stage right after I passed the first one and I instantly went into drawdown within the first 4 days with 2 trades that I held. Unfortunately, I closed both of them in losses but later went to full profit but after holding for multiple days and the Max Daily Loss being so close, I decided to close those trades at a loss. This led me to be in a drawdown. I was about 6% in drawdown, and I knew that if I just waited and waited for clear stepus\u00a0 that I could come back. So, I did. I waited about a week and changed and took my first trades back this week. I knew this week would be volatile due to Fed minutes, CPI data, and other economic reports so I knew this was my chance to hit winning trades to get back above my starting balance and hit that 5%.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Has your psychology ever affected your trading plan?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In all honesty, my psychology has not been affected with my trading plans even while being under drawdown on the Verification stage. The main thing about this Challenge is not hitting the Profit Target of 10% or 5%, but it\u2019s to not lose your fee cost that I paid to take the FTMO Challenge. I knew that if I fail that I can take the Challenge again, again, and again. This was around $160 for me, and it was something I was willing to lose if it came to it. Knowing that, I understood the requirements to move onto the next phase without anything affecting my psyche.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What was more difficult than expected during your FTMO Challenge or Verification?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In paper the FTMO Challenge should be more difficult because you need a 10% Profit Target compared to the Verification Profit Target of 5%. But this was not the case for me, I found it more difficult on the verification phase compared to the FTMO Challenge phase. The reason was being impatient. Once those first few trades I took brought me down into drawdown territory I knew I needed to just wait for the trade to come to me.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-565666\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Rutik-trades.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"904\" height=\"1321\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Rutik-trades.png 904w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Rutik-trades-205x300.png 205w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Rutik-trades-705x1030.png 705w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Rutik-trades-768x1122.png 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Rutik-trades-482x705.png 482w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Rutik-trades-16x24.png 16w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Rutik-trades-25x36.png 25w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Rutik-trades-33x48.png 33w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 904px) 100vw, 904px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Do you have a trading plan in place, and do you follow it strictly? <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I do have a trading plan in place. Before taking the FTMO Challenge, I have been using this strategy for a long time now, constantly gaining on my account, monthly. The strategy allows me to take trades with sniper entries for a better risk to reward allowing me to not be in a trade for too long. The one time I didn&#8217;t follow the strategy led me to drawdown. This was a great learning point because I was feeling the rush after the first phase and passing.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How did loss limits affect your trading style?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The Maximum Loss limits affect my trading style because I figured it would be realized losses and not unrealized losses. I didn&#8217;t know this, but this did have an effect on the position size because I didn&#8217;t want to come close to my Maximum Loss or even my Daily Loss.<\/p>\n<p><strong>One piece of advice for people starting the FTMO Challenge now.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The one piece of advice I would give to new people starting the FTMO Challenge and for future self when taking the Challenge again would be not to rush. If you have a consistent trading strategy and you backtested it and it works, then don&#8217;t fall under the pressure that you need to take trades. The trading clock doesn&#8217;t start when you purchase the Challenge, instead it starts when you make and input your first order. I would tell someone or future self to wait for days of volatility to begin trading. In addition, do not chase the trade if it&#8217;s\u00a0not there. Take the trades that come to you because those will be the winners.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/en\/scaling-plan?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=banner&amp;utm_campaign=tradersqa\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-546367 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_3-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"130\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_3-1.png 800w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_3-1-300x49.png 300w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_3-1-768x125.png 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_3-1-705x115.png 705w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_3-1-24x4.png 24w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_3-1-36x6.png 36w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_3-1-48x8.png 48w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Trader Densley: &#8220;Trading is a source of inspiration for me&#8221;<\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-565611\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Densley-300x267.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"267\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Densley-300x267.jpeg 300w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Densley-1030x918.jpeg 1030w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Densley-768x685.jpeg 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Densley-705x628.jpeg 705w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Densley-24x21.jpeg 24w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Densley-36x32.jpeg 36w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Densley-48x43.jpeg 48w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Densley.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>How has passing the Challenge and Verification changed your life?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Trading for FTMO taught me invaluable lessons about consistency, discipline, and self-belief.
