I attempted many challenges and have failed a good few. It took me losing and getting free re-tries before I realized that my strategy was more than good enough and after about a year I backtested my strategy and found for most of them I would have passed within the allotted time and for almost all of them would have been eligible for a free re-try.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Describe your best trade.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I was in a DD of about 3.71% and one of my high probability set ups came up on Cable. I executed perfectly it went in my favor instantly and within 3 hours my account was back into the green and it just got better with every trade.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What does your risk management plan look like?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I risk 40pips split into 10pips at 0.25% each with a 3% 80pip target, I use my top up EA and set the top up at 20% of my 80pip move. I like to have skin in the game and if the trade goes into my favor instantly its 1:12 Risk\/Reward, otherwise if it goes against me less than 40pips I get in at a better price level. Once my top up level gets triggered both my stop losses get moved into a position that I never have more than 0.25% risked on the trade at any time, I allow 4 entries of 0.25% for a total of 1% risked.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-537741 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Lawrence-trades.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"910\" height=\"1219\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Lawrence-trades.png 910w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Lawrence-trades-224x300.png 224w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Lawrence-trades-769x1030.png 769w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Lawrence-trades-768x1029.png 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Lawrence-trades-526x705.png 526w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Lawrence-trades-18x24.png 18w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Lawrence-trades-27x36.png 27w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Lawrence-trades-36x48.png 36w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 910px) 100vw, 910px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>What do you think is the key to long-term success in trading?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Maximizing the potential of your trading system by letting it do its thing and not interfering.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How did you manage your emotions when you were in a losing trade?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I allow the trade to happen good or bad, because I know that my trading strategy is profitable in a series of trades.

I felt it left too much for me to interpret and I didn\u2019t feel comfortable trading it, I needed something more mechanical. After watching YouTube and developing an algorithm with No Nonsense Forex it didn\u2019t fulfill my aspirational needs as it took too long, so I needed something faster, to that end I developed the strategy I have now which ticks all the boxes for me, and I can follow though easily.<\/p>\n<h3>Trader Shawn: &#8220;The pursuit of constant improvement inspires and drives me to continue.&#8221;<\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-537717\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Shawn-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Shawn-225x300.jpg 225w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Shawn-773x1030.jpg 773w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Shawn-768x1024.jpg 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Shawn-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Shawn-1536x2048.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Shawn-1125x1500.jpg 1125w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Shawn-529x705.jpg 529w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Shawn-18x24.jpg 18w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Shawn-27x36.jpg 27w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Shawn-36x48.jpg 36w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Shawn-scaled.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Do you have a trading plan in place, and do you follow it strictly?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Yes, every trader must have a plan in place to allow him to follow his edge down to the tee.

I believe the challenge itself is a great way to put traders who think they are ready for funding through the psychological rigmarole of time constraints and profit targets. You learn a thing or two about yourself during the process.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What would you like to say to other traders that are attempting the FTMO Challenge?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Make sure you have a well-tested strategy, and you are confident in your ability and edge to follow your rules without hesitation.

Early on during my first challenge attempt I reached a 9% open balance, trying to seal the deal with only 1% to go I increased my risk while still following my strategy. Unfortunately, when I increased my risk, the market got really choppy and with a few trades at increased risk I quickly lost most of the profit I had made. Bad timing but also very eye opening, when you think you have reached your goal anything can happen (especially in the markets). Getting funded by FTMO is a huge steppingstone for my trading career, as this will be my first-time trading for a prop firm, I hope it may eventually lead to being able to trade full time.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Do you plan to take another FTMO Challenge to manage an even bigger balance?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Yes, I am currently in an ongoing challenge. I plan to take a third challenge once I pass the first stage of my current challenge.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What was easier than expected during your FTMO Challenge or Verification?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Starting the challenges, I always start with 1% risk until I have a buffer to increase my risk to 2% per trade. For the verification it was relatively easy to reach 5% while trading with 1% risk. Although for the first part reaching 10%, I found that every time I increase my risk, I get a couple loses for some reason eliminating my initial profit, this happened again during my second ongoing challenge.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-537762\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Jacob-trades.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"912\" height=\"1223\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Jacob-trades.png 912w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Jacob-trades-224x300.png 224w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Jacob-trades-768x1030.png 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Jacob-trades-526x705.png 526w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Jacob-trades-18x24.png 18w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Jacob-trades-27x36.png 27w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Jacob-trades-36x48.png 36w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 912px) 100vw, 912px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Describe your best trade.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>My best trade was late February, on USDJPY right before the market collapse. I got a really good entry and kept it all the way down until I saw it was best to get out.

It has worked very well for me so far, so I have learned to trust and stick to my trading plan. Of course, I have let myself trade outside of it in the past but found that it was almost always negative in result. Discipline is the only way for my strategy to work as it should.
