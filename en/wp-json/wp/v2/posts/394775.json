Price on Gold has never been that low since August 2008. Shortly after, price reversed and rallied up to $1430. 3 months later, we tested the $1200 level again in December 2013 and the price bounced again. Price hasn&#8217;t tested that level until another 10 months later in December 2014.<\/p>\n<p>It is <strong>not a coincidence<\/strong> that we see the price\u00a0coming and reversing at a price level over and over again. It is very<strong> simple logic.<\/strong> When the price drops to a level and reverses, it marks a <strong>reversal level<\/strong> on a chart. This is to be interpreted as buyers coming into the market and overpowering the sellers, driving prices up. The second time price drops to that level, traders have to ask themselves: &#8216;Buyers have come into the market at $1200 on Gold. <strong>Where is a logical price level to enter?<\/strong> Obviously, 3 months ago (first reversal) buyers did not allow the\u00a0price of Gold drop below $1200, so there should be traders waiting at $1200 again to go long, right?&#8217; This thought proved to be right and price reversed off from our $1200 price level again&#8230; And again in December 2013.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_36901\" style=\"width: 1040px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/GOLDDaily.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-36901\" class=\"wp-image-36901 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/GOLDDaily-1030x579.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1030\" height=\"579\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/GOLDDaily-1030x579.png 1030w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/GOLDDaily-300x169.png 300w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/GOLDDaily-768x432.png 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/GOLDDaily-1500x844.png 1500w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/GOLDDaily-705x397.png 705w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/GOLDDaily-450x253.png 450w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/GOLDDaily.png 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1030px) 100vw, 1030px\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-36901\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Gold &#8211; Daily<\/p><\/div>\n<p>The graphical representation of this <strong>reversal level<\/strong> is the horizontal line drawn on the chart.

Price action strategies are very popular among many traders as it has a very simple and logical reasoning behind it. Price Action Traders are usually happy with a naked price chart. No indicators\u00a0are required as the price is the purest information about an instrument.<\/p>\n<p>The thought process of a Price Action trader is the following:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Analyze past price movement to project demand &amp; supply levels<\/li>\n<li>Capitalize on the projections by looking for trading opportunities<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>One method to project supply &amp; demand levels are, but not limited to, Support &amp; Resistance (S&amp;R) zones, Trendlines, Fibonacci ratios or Highs &amp; Lows (H&amp;L). In this Article, I will present you a few simple trading strategies using only S&amp;R levels and basic candlestick patterns.<\/p>\n<p>Conventionally, Price Action Traders will fall into one of the two main categories:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Reversal Trading<\/li>\n<li>Breakout Trading<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2>Reversal Trading<\/h2>\n<p>Reversal traders project supply &amp; demand levels and when the price hits these levels, they expect the price to reverse in their favour. In the following example, we will use candlestick patterns to confirm successful reversals.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_36937\" style=\"width: 1040px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/BTCUSDH1after-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-36937\" class=\"wp-image-36937 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/BTCUSDH1after-1-1030x579.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1030\" height=\"579\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/BTCUSDH1after-1-1030x579.png 1030w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/BTCUSDH1after-1-300x169.png 300w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/BTCUSDH1after-1-768x432.png 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/BTCUSDH1after-1-1500x844.png 1500w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/BTCUSDH1after-1-705x397.png 705w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/BTCUSDH1after-1-450x253.png 450w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/BTCUSDH1after-1.png 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1030px) 100vw, 1030px\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-36937\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">BTCUSD &#8211; H1<\/p><\/div>\n<p>The chart above is on the BTCUSD hourly.\u00a0 We can spot the first high after a bull run. The second high was then confirmed by a <strong>bearish Pin bar<\/strong>. Notice how the Pin bar\u00a0doesn&#8217;t exactly respect the previous high, however, what we want to see is some signs of reversal. Now we have two established highs and with these, we will construct our resistance level. The reversal trader now waits for the price to test this level again, which did happen a third time. Of course, we do not want to enter blindly into the third test. We require some kind of confirmation to distinguish a simple price spike from an actual breakout. On the chart, we see another bearish Pin bar that confirms our reversal idea and we put a sell order below the bearish Pin bar.<\/p>\n<p>Nevertheless, an idea for entry is not enough. A trader is required to have a <strong>solid trading plan<\/strong>, knowing when to get out. His idea will be proved wrong if price breaks the high of the Pin bar after the entry. In such a case, the Pin bar would be a false signal and our resistance level would have failed. If our idea is proven to be right, we will be looking for a probable <strong>Take-Profit level<\/strong>. The previous low is a good demand level, as traders decided to push the price up there. In other words, we expect buyers not pushing the price higher, not before testing the previous low as shown in the chart.<\/p>\n<p>This trade setup <strong>has a very good RRR and we see<\/strong>, that the previous low was almost ignored. Nonetheless, our Take-Profit has a clearly defined logic and we should not change our trading plan based on one single trade.<\/p>\n<h2>Breakout Trading<\/h2>\n<p>Breakout traders expect S&amp;R levels to fail. According to our previous explanation in the previous article, Support is a level of high demand and Resistance is a high level of supply. But what if these levels fail?<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_36964\" style=\"width: 1040px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/USDCHFH4bearishengulfing.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-36964\" class=\"wp-image-36964 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/USDCHFH4bearishengulfing-1030x579.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1030\" height=\"579\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/USDCHFH4bearishengulfing-1030x579.png 1030w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/USDCHFH4bearishengulfing-300x169.png 300w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/USDCHFH4bearishengulfing-768x432.png 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/USDCHFH4bearishengulfing-1500x844.png 1500w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/USDCHFH4bearishengulfing-705x397.png 705w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/USDCHFH4bearishengulfing-450x253.png 450w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/USDCHFH4bearishengulfing.png 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1030px) 100vw, 1030px\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-36964\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">USDCHF_H4 Chart<\/p><\/div>\n<p>In this example, we are on the USDCHF 4-hourly. The price made two lows, establishing a <strong>support level<\/strong>. On the third test, we saw a bearish candle closing below our support. This is the first signal that the support level has failed and that the price might want to head lower. However, in order to increase our chances of success, traders often wait for a retest of the broken support. We can see the retest after the breakout on the chart. When price touched the broken support, it printed a bearish engulfing candlestick pattern. This is our confirmation for the breakout and we would enter at the low of this pattern. <strong>Stop-Loss<\/strong> is then set above highs of this pattern. This is a very good entry and Stop-Loss placement.<\/p>\n<p>However, now we have a problem. In order to set our Profit Target, we would have to look for the next support level. However, there are no data on the higher timeframes to find such levels. As an alternative, we can use another tool to project our demand levels, the <strong>Fibonacci extension tool.<\/strong><\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_36970\" style=\"width: 1040px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/USDCHFH4extension.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-36970\" class=\"wp-image-36970 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/USDCHFH4extension-1030x579.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1030\" height=\"579\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/USDCHFH4extension-1030x579.png 1030w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/USDCHFH4extension-300x169.png 300w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/USDCHFH4extension-768x432.png 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/USDCHFH4extension-1500x844.png 1500w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/USDCHFH4extension-705x397.png 705w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/USDCHFH4extension-450x253.png 450w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/USDCHFH4extension.png 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1030px) 100vw, 1030px\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-36970\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">USDCHF_H4 Chart<\/p><\/div>\n<p>Here we see our trade in the bigger picture.

ceiling for price, with support being the floor, and resistance being the ceiling.<\/p>\n<p>It is typically common for price to have a harder time breaking through these zones, which is why it is important to mark up and pay attention to these zones to use as a confluence among other confirmations for trade set-ups, as the price has to either break through or reject a zone.<\/p>\n<p>Support and resistance zones are typically stronger on higher time frames, but are still useful on smaller time frames, so it is important to identify zones on multiple time frames.<\/p>\n<p>Supports and resistances sometimes work so nicely and sometimes they don\u2019t work at all.<\/p>\n<p>So many traders wonder: \u201cAre they really so important as one says? Why everyone wants to use them if they are not 100% sure? Why they are not always so powerful as expected?<\/p>\n<p>The first thing to say is they are not a complete trading strategy to use.<\/p>\n<p>They cannot be used blindly in every circumstance and without confirmations.<\/p>\n<p>Because of that, we want to give a good tip and shortcut to identify only best levels avoiding being lost with tons of lines and try to add more odds in our favour when we want to enter into a trade.<\/p>\n<h3>How to identify support and resistance levels?<\/h3>\n<p>Supports and Resistances are like walls, something that the current price has difficult on breaking it through.

Well, there is not a right or wrong approach, you can use both wick or bodies of the candles when making your S\/R level.<\/p>\n<p>The general rule of thumb is that markets have memory, that&#8217;s why it is not a bad idea to use levels which played significantly well in the past, increasing the likelihood they might do so again in the future.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/9.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-415093\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/9.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1030\" height=\"529\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Supply and Demand<\/h3>\n<p>Contrary to classical support and resistance levels, some traders prefer to look for supply and demand areas on their charts.<\/p>\n<p>These areas are generally zones where you can spot aggressive participation based on supply and demand dynamics.<\/p>\n<p>If you have a strong move up, it means that demand overcomes supply, i.e., buyers were more aggressive than sellers. Once this zone is revisited, we can expect renewed buying at the zone.<br \/>\nOf course, the same goes for selling.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/10.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-415098\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/10.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1030\" height=\"501\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Volume Profile<\/h3>\n<p>One of the less popular ways to find support and resistance areas is to use the volume profile. This method is often used among futures traders, but it works well in forex as well.<\/p>\n<p>We have recently published a series of videos and articles about using volume profile, market profile, and auction market theory in your trading. You can find it right <a href=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/en\/market-profile\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>To explain briefly, the price often uses High Volume Nodes (HVNs) as support and resistance levels, especially when there is also a POC (point of control). Compared to price action and supply and demand, the volume profile has the advantage of being less subjective, giving you exact levels to buy and sell.<\/p>\n<p>You can also use Low volume nodes (LVNs) and other HVNs as your targets.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/11.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-415103\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/11.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1030\" height=\"501\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Pivot Points<\/h3>\n<p>Last on our list are Pivot points, and these are the least subjective from the list.<\/p>\n<p>And even though some traders have strict anti-indicator approach in their trading, Pivot Points are trendy even among professional traders.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/12.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-415108\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/12.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1030\" height=\"501\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Trend Lines<\/h2>\n<p>Trend lines hold a lot of significance as well because the basically serve as a diagonal support\/resistance.<\/p>\n<p>A rule of thumb is that if you can put a diagonal line below price where it has a least two touches of the line without breaking, it is in an uptrend, and vice versa for a downtrend.<\/p>\n<p>The more touches price has on one of these trend lines, the stronger the trend line is.<\/p>\n<p>Now to tie these two together, imagine you are trading a pair which has been selling off heavily for the past several days, and it is approaching a support zone where it has bounced off of twice, and it would also be the third of the trend line you drew.<\/p>\n<p>This would be a great zone to watch and see how price reacts when it touches it, for a possible long set up.<\/p>\n<p>The touches on the trendline should be spread out along the trendline instead of clustereted at one place.<\/p>\n<p>General rule of thumb is the the longer the trendline, the more significance it holds.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Screenshot_2.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-394785\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Screenshot_2-1030x631.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1030\" height=\"631\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Screenshot_2-1030x631.png 1030w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Screenshot_2-300x184.png 300w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Screenshot_2-768x471.png 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Screenshot_2-705x432.png 705w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Screenshot_2.png 1460w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1030px) 100vw, 1030px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Chart Patterns<\/h2>\n<p>Now as we have covered horizontal and diagontal support and resitance.<\/p>\n<p>We can have a look at chart patterns as they are combination of both.<\/p>\n<p>Chart patterns are one of the oldest parts of technical analysis and price action trading.<\/p>\n<p>They were proven many times as a functional way to help technical traders identify the next market direction.<\/p>\n<p>That being said, a trader should not forget about the context and current market conditions while making decisions in trading.<\/p>\n<h3>Head and Shoulders Pattern<\/h3>\n<p>Head and shoulders pattern is believed to be one of the most reliable reversal patterns. It starts after a long bullish trend when the price rises to the peak and pulls back. Shortly after, the price rises again to a significantly higher peak but declines again. Finally, the price goes up for the third time but only reaches a level of the first high. After that, it pulls back and completes the pattern which signals that an uptrend is ending and the price is about to decline.<\/p>\n<p>The first and third peaks are the shoulders and the second peak is the head. The support level where the price bounces from is called a neckline and is often used as entry-level on a break.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-145863 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/hns.png\" alt=\"Head and Shoulders\" width=\"1828\" height=\"898\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/hns.png 1828w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/hns-300x147.png 300w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/hns-768x377.png 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/hns-1030x506.png 1030w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/hns-1500x737.png 1500w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/hns-705x346.png 705w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/hns-450x221.png 450w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1828px) 100vw, 1828px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Inverse Head and Shoulders Pattern<\/h3>\n<p>As with other patterns, there is also an inverse head and shoulders which occurs after an extended downtrend and indicates that price will go up.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-145864\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/ihns.png\" alt=\"Inverse Head and Shoulders\" width=\"1828\" height=\"898\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/ihns.png 1828w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/ihns-300x147.png 300w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/ihns-768x377.png 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/ihns-1030x506.png 1030w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/ihns-1500x737.png 1500w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/ihns-705x346.png 705w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/ihns-450x221.png 450w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1828px) 100vw, 1828px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>You can notice on both charts that breaking off a <strong>neckline<\/strong> would give us a great trading opportunity.<\/p>\n<p>In the second case, you could even use a neckline retest as a second entry.<\/p>\n<h3>Cup And Handle Patterns<\/h3>\n<p>A cup and handle pattern is a bullish continuation pattern.

It is a bearish reversal pattern which is characterized by the peak which is shortly followed by the second one at the same or very similar price point.<\/p>\n<p>The double top pattern is valid once the price breaks the support made bellow the highs.<\/p>\n<p>We use the same term &#8220;neckline&#8221; which is also used with the Head and Shoulders Pattern.<\/p>\n<p>You can either enter the trade once the neckline is broken or wait for the retest of the neckline.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-152881\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/double-top.png\" alt=\"double top\" width=\"1828\" height=\"898\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/double-top.png 1828w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/double-top-300x147.png 300w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/double-top-768x377.png 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/double-top-1030x506.png 1030w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/double-top-1500x737.png 1500w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/double-top-705x346.png 705w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/double-top-450x221.png 450w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1828px) 100vw, 1828px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Double Bottom Pattern<\/h3>\n<p>The opposite of the Double Top is the Double Bottom pattern which is made at the bottom of the downtrend.<\/p>\n<p>The Double Bottom is characterized as two bottoms at an equal or similar price level.<\/p>\n<p>Same as with the Double Top pattern, you can enter either at the break of the &#8220;neckline&#8221; or its retest.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-152894\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/double-bottom.png\" alt=\"double bottom\" width=\"1828\" height=\"849\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/double-bottom.png 1828w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/double-bottom-300x139.png 300w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/double-bottom-768x357.png 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/double-bottom-1030x478.png 1030w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/double-bottom-1500x697.png 1500w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/double-bottom-705x327.png 705w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/double-bottom-450x209.png 450w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1828px) 100vw, 1828px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Flags<\/h3>\n<p>Flags are technical patterns which can be understood as a pause in the underlying trend.<\/p>\n<p>Flags are spotted as consolidation after a fast trend in the market and they signal the continuation after the breakout.<\/p>\n<p>As with all chart patterns, we have a Bull and Bear flag.<\/p>\n<h4>Bull Flag<\/h4>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-152917\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/bullflag.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1828\" height=\"898\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/bullflag.png 1828w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/bullflag-300x147.png 300w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/bullflag-768x377.png 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/bullflag-1030x506.png 1030w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/bullflag-1500x737.png 1500w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/bullflag-705x346.png 705w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/bullflag-450x221.png 450w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1828px) 100vw, 1828px\" \/><\/p>\n<h4>Bear Flag<\/h4>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-152947\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/bearflag.png\" alt=\"Bear Flag\" width=\"1828\" height=\"898\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/bearflag.png 1828w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/bearflag-300x147.png 300w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/bearflag-768x377.png 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/bearflag-1030x506.png 1030w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/bearflag-1500x737.png 1500w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/bearflag-705x346.png 705w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/bearflag-450x221.png 450w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1828px) 100vw, 1828px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>Fibonacci Retracement Tool<\/h2>\n<p>Fibonacci Tool is very popular among retail traders. Many traders say that there is a magic in Fibonacci numbers like .236, .382, .618 or .786. These numbers generally work because a lot of people are just watching them.<\/p>\n<p>The market trends in waves made up of two components, impulse moves and correctional moves.<\/p>\n<p>An impulse move is the strong initial move a pair makes, but since a pair can not move in one direction forever, at some point buyers or sellers will get exhausted and a pullback\/correction must occur to give the market some balance.<\/p>\n<p>The Fibonacci tool measures from the high to the low, or the low to the high of an impulse move, and shows you the different percentage levels where the price is likely to pull back.<\/p>\n<p>To give an example of using the Fibonacci tool in confluence with you trading, imagine the price of a pair has an impulsive move, breaks an important resistance level and forms a high above it.<\/p>\n<p>You then draw your Fibonacci from low to high and see that the resistance that it broke (now turned support) now sits at the 61.8 Fib level.<\/p>\n<p>This would be a good confluence when thinking about taking a long position when seeing how price reacts if it pulls back to this level.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/13.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-415113\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/13.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1030\" height=\"585\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>In Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p>When formulating a strategy or your trading system, it is important that you find something that works for you.<\/p>\n<p>It may not work for someone else, but if it proves to be profitable for you, then it is all that matters.<\/p>\n<p>As indicators lag behind the price, learning how to interpret and read the Price Action will allow you to see all the possibilities for the market\u2019s next move and how you can anticipate that.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>There are so many different trading strategies traders can utilize in their endeavours to be a successful trader.
