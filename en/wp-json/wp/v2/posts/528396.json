I&#8217;ve been through a lot lately and I lost my first account due to my state of mind: I was feeling bad, not clear thinking, upset, emotional and sad. I recommend everyone to not take decision if you&#8217;re experiencing some hard time in life. Solve your problems first, especially emotional problems as you will react following your emotion and not following your trading strategy.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Describe your best trade.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It was just after some news, where there was a grab of liquidity and I saw this as a clear opportunity. Few days later I took the profit I needed to reach the target.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How did you manage your emotions when you were in a losing trade?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I manage the trade and my emotion pretty easy; I had my stop, and I knew how much I was risking so not too much emotions involved.

Be patience and ready to experience some pressure, stress, and all kind of new emotions. Trading can be very easy and hard at the same time. I would suggest to have a plan B if the market it&#8217;s not going your way and take some time off if you&#8217;re not 100%. It&#8217;s better not to rush if you&#8217;re not feeling ready.

Usually, I start out by drawing out a Fibonacci Retracement on the higher time frame (4hr or Day chart) and then look to enter a trading position on the lower time frames (1mins &#8211; 15mins). The Fib retracement tool helps me to create a picture of the direction in which the market is gravitating towards. You cannot simply guess what will happen and it&#8217;s imperative that you do not trade by luck as sooner or later that luck will run out.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How did you manage your emotions when you were in a losing trade?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s important to stay relaxed and to avoid stressing whilst in a losing trade or a growing draw-down. Markets can often be volatile especially during the recent outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine war and consequently, rising inflation and interest rates. Therefore, it&#8217;s important to take every loss as a learning curve and seek to understand what went wrong rather than revenge trading. I have been a victim of revenge trading in previous failed challenges and have had to learn the hard way! Revenge trading often leads to total chaos and therefore, it&#8217;s important to self-reflect and at times, walk away from the market when you are feeling overwhelmed.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Do you plan to take another FTMO Challenge to manage even bigger capital?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Yes, I have also passed a \u00a370,000 Challenge &amp; Verification (1300239093) and will be looking to combine with this account in a Master \u00a390,000 account. I have also started a further \u00a310,000 FTMO Challenge and currently 8.5% up on the Challenge. My hope is to add this onto the Master account which will give me a funded trading capital of \u00a3100,000. At the point, I would like to stop with the Challenges &#8211; I have taken quite a few and failed them also \ud83d\ude41 and I would like to focus on earning some real profits. If I can demonstrate 6 months of profit on my \u00a3100k account, I will then look to take the \u00a3140,000 FTMO Challenge.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-528552 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/V20910403.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1016\" height=\"1340\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/V20910403.png 1016w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/V20910403-227x300.png 227w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/V20910403-781x1030.png 781w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/V20910403-768x1013.png 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/V20910403-535x705.png 535w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/V20910403-18x24.png 18w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/V20910403-27x36.png 27w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/V20910403-36x48.png 36w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1016px) 100vw, 1016px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>What inspires you to pursue trading?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Financial freedom and technical analysis. I currently work an IT Project Manager and although my role can be interesting, it&#8217;s not something which I would like to pursue for the foreseeable future. Trading forex allows you to recognise profits which I&#8217;m hoping in the long-term can help me to drop my full-time job. I also relish the thrill of trading &#8211; I enjoy carrying out my technical analysis and setting up my trading positions. This requires a level of intelligence, integrity and independence which is highly motivating.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What do you think is the most important characteristic\/attribute of a profitable trader?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Risk management and consistency. It&#8217;s better to trade small and realise consistent profits over the long-run rather than opening aggressive positions to chase big profits. Technical analysis is also essential and being able to demonstrate the knowledge and intelligence of moving markets &#8211; this can be developed over time and with experience. Having a risk management strategy in place in which you only trade x amount of positions per day with a total of x lot sizes can also be a major element of becoming a profitable trader. This is because it enforces a level of discipline within your schedule and avoids the possibility of overtrading or revenge trading.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What is the number one piece of advice you would give to a new trader?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Take it easy and trust the process! Trading is not a competition, and it is definitely not a race. Everybody learns at their own pace and it&#8217;s important to seek the fundamental knowledge prior to trading at any level. I would definitely recommend BabyPips.com and overall, try not to rush.
