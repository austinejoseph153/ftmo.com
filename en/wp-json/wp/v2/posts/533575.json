I have been on and off demo trading for about 4 years and only traded real money two times and I didn\u2019t really get anywhere at the time (about 3 years ago). I heard about the FTMO Challenge many times, but never really considered trying it until recently. I do know that I\u2019m a good trader, but actually doing it for real did make me a bit nervous at the start. Once I realized I just needed to do the same thing as I have practiced, it went pretty smoothly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>How did you manage your emotions when you were in a losing trade?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I usually try to close losers early, unless I have a specific reason not to (like a smaller Stop Loss, for example). But I usually stay pretty calm about it because I know that my winners are bigger most of the time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>What was the most difficult during your FTMO Challenge or Verification and how did you overcome it?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the first week I was a bit nervous and made a few trading mistakes. That was the most difficult part for me, to stay confident when it\u2019s for real. I did some meditation a few times and I think that helped to get my mind in a quiet place.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-533643\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Dirk-trades.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"912\" height=\"1222\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Dirk-trades.png 912w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Dirk-trades-224x300.png 224w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Dirk-trades-769x1030.png 769w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Dirk-trades-768x1029.png 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Dirk-trades-526x705.png 526w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Dirk-trades-18x24.png 18w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Dirk-trades-27x36.png 27w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Dirk-trades-36x48.png 36w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 912px) 100vw, 912px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Has your psychology ever affected your trading plan?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It did in the first week of the challenge, but after that I managed to stick to the plan.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What do you think is the key for long-term success in trading?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s one key.

According to my RSI and the moving averages I used; the market has a high probability to make a downtrend movement.

You have to be able to go weeks without a winning trade and not let your strategy fold. You also need the patience to not take a trade when there is a setup which fits all but one of your criteria, as this would ruin your edge if you took it.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What is the number one advice you would give to a new trader?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Backtest your strategy and work out statistics such as, the win rate, the average win size and how long you have gone without a win.

I&#8217;d say the thing I loved the most about the FTMO Challenge &amp; Verification was how when you surpass the minimum day requirements after meeting all necessary targets, how you can move onto the next step.

It&#8217;s a skill that not many can be asked to learn. So in a way, traders are unique.
