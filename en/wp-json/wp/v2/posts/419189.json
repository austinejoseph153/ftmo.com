Initially, I deposited 500 dollars with a broker here in Sri Lanka and doubled the account within a week. I thought money-making was super easy and wanted to be a millionaire in my early 20s. But that dream was broken within a week when I lost the capital during the next week itself. But the passion for trading and spending with charts was never been a boring routine to do from then onwards.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How did you manage your emotions when you were in a losing trade?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In the initial days, I used to enter into the trade after the trade when I was in losing momentum. However, I changed that behaviour and nowadays I usually take a few hours break or sometimes daybreak if I have a couple of losing trades. I decide on the break duration based on my instinct and that works well for me now. and I will follow the same in the future too.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/mathm.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-419201\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/mathm.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"752\" height=\"904\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>How does your risk management plan look like?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I recently started planning my week ahead and that becomes my success story here. I am improving the risk management week by week. I certainly look at my past records and correct it every week. Trying to minimize the losses based on the market condition. I am not going to fix a percentage for every trade rather I look at the market potential and decide the Stop loss based on my lot size. However, I usually keep anywhere between 1 to 3 percentage per trade.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What was the hardest obstacle on your trading journey?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Controlling my emotion was the toughest part to overcome. I used to have overconfident when I had continuous winning momentum and the same way I used to put trade after trade when I used to have lost momentum. I realized that was because of my emotional interference with my trade plan. and step by step I took the emotion away from my trading.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How would you rate your experience with FTMO?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>5star.

It&#8217;s much better to call it a day after a loss instead of grinding, with the potential risk to ruin the entire month, plus, you systematically decrease the probability of consecutive losses, since you end up not trading the same scenario multiple times.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What do you think is the key to long-term success in trading?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Humility, perseverance, a strong mind and a decent IQ.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How has passing the FTMO Challenge and Verification changed your life?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m now able to trade 40k euros, so the undercapitalization problem is immediately solved, knowing that I can potentially earn my country&#8217;s average monthly wage with a single trade.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/simonem.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-419219\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/simonem.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"755\" height=\"900\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>Where have you learnt about FTMO?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>A friend of mine told me about it.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How would you rate your experience with FTMO?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>10\/10.

Also, the fact that I am a new father, my daughter is also the reason I started learning how to trade because I knew a 9-5 would always get in the way of the time I spend with her which I wasn&#8217;t about to allow. If it wasn&#8217;t for her I probably wouldn&#8217;t have even tried to look for something outside of what I used to do career-wise.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Do you have a trading plan in place, and do you follow it strictly?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>yes, I absolutely do and I follow it to the max.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What was more difficult than expected during your FTMO Challenge or Verification?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The want to trade more volume due to higher account size, at first the amounts were definitely something to get used too. But always having a percentage mindset instead of a monetary view point was the answer, as well as always sticking to your rules.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What would you like to say to other traders that are attempting the FTMO Challenge?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Take your time, aim for 2-3% a week. pick one session and only trade that. 1-2 pairs. and 1% risk per trade and do not go over that. Lastly do not force anything. the fastest way to fail in these markets is to rush yourself.<\/p>\n<h3>Trader Thiago &#8211; <em>&#8220;I feel fulfilled, I love forex and I want to live my life with freedom&#8221;<\/em><\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/ThiagoP.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-419239\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/ThiagoP.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"316\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>Do you plan to take another FTMO Challenge to manage even bigger capital?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>My plan is to grow together with your company, I am focused on getting the account increase step by step, seeking the 90% division is also one of my goals. I performed some calculations and my prediction is that in 3 years I will reach the 400k account, but if I feel confident and with a much sharper trading plan, it&#8217;s okay to postpone this time and jump to a bigger account, but I have a long-term thought that will bring much fruit to both sides.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How does your risk management plan look like?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>My management plan consists of dividing the daily loss by 5 in the case of my 35K account, the daily loss is \u00a31,750, so entry on trades is this my \u00a3350 stop seeking 1:5 risk return, when the zone is too big I split that \u00a3350 in two, coming in with \u00a3175 and looking for a risk return of 1:10.
