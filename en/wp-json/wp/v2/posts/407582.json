market stopping traders out before going in their desired direction.<\/p>\n<p>If you have a tight Stop Loss, you might increase the position size if your target success rate is high.<\/p>\n<p>Although this can work out from time to time, we cannot let the greed of monetary gains cloud our analysis of the market.<\/p>\n<p>To fix this problem you can never let greed overcome you when you are calculating the size of your position and place your stop at a technical level where you know you are wrong on your idea.<\/p>\n<p>Otherwise, you will end up like those traders who always get stopped out before the market goes in their direction, and no one wants that!<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/sltight.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"

skewed because you can only open very small positions.<\/p>\n<p>How to fix this?<\/p>\n<p>The answer for this is journaling and taking notes about your Maximum Adverse Excursion.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/en\/how-can-you-improve-your-stop-loss-and-take-profit\/\">Maximum Adverse Excursion<\/a> measures the largest loss suffered by a single trade while it is open.<\/p>\n<p>So if you enter the trade with 40 pip stop and 100 pip target and the trade goes 20 pips against you first, your MAE is 20 pips.<\/p>\n<p>By taking notes in your journal about MAE, you can easily find out your MAE and tighten your Stop Losses.<\/p>\n<p>Not to make them too tight, but to adjust them based on your trading results.<\/p>\n<p><a
