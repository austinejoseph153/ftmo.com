I risk about 0.5%- 1.5% depending on market conditions. I always make sure to calculate my Stop Loss before each trade. My win-rate ranges between 30%-40% as I prefer to target a risk to reward ratio of at least 1:2.5.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Has your psychology ever affected your trading plan?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The psychological aspect of trading can be overwhelming. There are several instances where poor psychology has made me close trades too early only to see the market move in my intended direction. But through awareness I realized that developing discipline and trusting my trading plan was the key in balancing my trading psychology.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Do you plan to take another FTMO Challenge to manage an even bigger capital?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Of course! That is part of my long-term goals. However, in the meantime I want to focus my attention on consistency, growth, and development with my newly funded account. I plan to take another challenge whenever is appropriate.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-548399 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Frank-trades.png\" alt=\"trader Frank\" width=\"906\" height=\"1319\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Frank-trades.png 906w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Frank-trades-206x300.png 206w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Frank-trades-707x1030.png 707w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Frank-trades-768x1118.png 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Frank-trades-484x705.png 484w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Frank-trades-16x24.png 16w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Frank-trades-25x36.png 25w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Frank-trades-33x48.png 33w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 906px) 100vw, 906px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>How did passing the FTMO Challenge and Verification change your life?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This milestone has been one of the most exciting experiences of my life. It was a journey that has taught me one or two huge lesson(s). These include strict adherence to rules in order to achieve a task as well as maintaining a high level of discipline owing to following the FTMO Trading Objectives. This has built in me a sense of confidence during trading. Moreover, I am also happy knowing that I have bigger capital to trade\/manage which could not have been possible with my own money. I believe that this is not the end of my story, but more success awaits me in the future. Ready to work even harder towards my journey as a professional trader.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Describe your best trade.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This trade was on XAUUSD pair. I was super-excited as it gave a return of over 2% passing the verification stage. After in-depth analysis the day before, directional bias was unclear to me. Hence, I decided wait for the New York session. And as anticipated price gave me the required set up that I was waiting for. I took that sell trade with risk management and within a few minutes my profit target was reached. This proved to me the need to always trust your plan and execute with confidence.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What would you like to say to other traders that are attempting the FTMO Challenge?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>My huge advice to these traders is that they should treat trading as a business. This means doing things that a typical businessperson will do to grow their business. Have trading plan\/strategy, backtest it well enough and maintain the discipline to follow it. Lastly, they should understand that losses are part of the trading industry, but it is through that that traders discover themselves to become even better.

But with that challenge I knew that it was possible for me to reach that because realistically that is what I would like to make in profits every time I want to get a payout. Obviously that profit target is just a starting point since I am a newer trader, but it definitely pushes me to be better.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How has passing the FTMO Challenge and Verification changed your life?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This is a huge win for me as when I started my trading journey, I felt a bit discouraged because I wasn&#8217;t understanding it so well until I found my mentor who stuck it out with me for about 2.5 years being on and off about it. But this year I really wanted to go full force with it because I knew this skill would help me with my financial struggles and for me to leave my job where I had reached a plateau in already. Trading will give me the opportunity to make money in my own time while also helping me fund my other business.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What does your risk management plan look like?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I normally stick to a 3:1 or 2:1 risk\/reward ratio depending on how my setup looks. I also am really adamant about taking only 1-2 trades in the day. If I profit on the 1st trade, then I am done for the day but if I lose my first trade then I give myself a second chance whether I win or lose.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-548406 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Natalia-trades.png\" alt=\"trader Natalia\" width=\"905\" height=\"1299\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Natalia-trades.png 905w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Natalia-trades-209x300.png 209w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Natalia-trades-718x1030.png 718w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Natalia-trades-768x1102.png 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Natalia-trades-491x705.png 491w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Natalia-trades-17x24.png 17w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Natalia-trades-25x36.png 25w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Natalia-trades-33x48.png 33w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 905px) 100vw, 905px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>What was easier than expected during the FTMO Challenge or Verification?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The target profit for the Verification was the easiest part since it was lower than the challenge TP, so it felt less daunting to reach that 5%. This made me more confident.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What inspires you to pursue trading?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>FREEDOM! That is what inspires me. I want the financial freedom of writing my own checks and not having to be in an office where I don&#8217;t want to be in everyday working for someone else.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What is the number one advice you would give to a new trader?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Look at the charts every day! Even if it&#8217;s only for an hour. Even if you&#8217;re not going to place that trade in MT4 but you&#8217;re just practicing your setups, your rules, paying attention to the patterns that happen on a daily basis on your preferred pair. Back testing and journaling your trades are also very important. Once I zoned into these disciplined habits, trading became almost second nature because I created a system that I knew worked for me. Also having trading view on my phone has been a very powerful tool and I use it almost as much as I use Instagram.

Once I get to larger accounts (100k plus) I plan on utilizing 30% of the available funds on a more swing-progressive plan and the 70% on short term and target day trades. I never move my stop once it is set &#8211; I know to be successful that I need to stick to my risk parameters. I also will only make 2 trades in a given day &#8211; I don&#8217;t want to over-trade or over-expose my account.
