Hone your skills. It&#8217;s worth it in the long run.&#8221;<\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-545051\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Oluwatobi-300x300.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>What was easier than expected during the FTMO Challenge or Verification?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The profit target for the verification stage.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What was the most difficult during your FTMO Challenge or Verification and how did you overcome it?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Disciplining myself to stick to 0.25% to 1% exposure. I needed to deny myself of some opportunities to imbibe the culture of discipline. The solution was accountability and I have a trading mentor who goes through all my trades every day. The fact that I needed to defend my trades made me very accountable. And it is someone I respect so much who has handled huge accounts in the past. We also planned every week, what and how to trade. If we were looking for a &#8220;BUY&#8221; I would never take any sell opportunities that day or trade any pair, I did not plan to trade initially.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How did you manage your emotions when you were in a losing trade?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This borders much on psychology, science, and emotions. Psychology\/Emotions &#8211; as always, I train my mind to accept the worst that could happen, and then I find it easy to overcome. More so, I manage and cut my losses and let it go. Conclusively, every good trader must be a professional loss manager &#8211; Michael J. Huddleston Science (empirical approach) &#8211; Using a RRR (risk to reward ratio) allows one to set the max loss per trade, you would then have nothing to fear. You know for a fact, if your RRR is 1:3, meaning out of 10 trades, you can lose 7 trades. You only need less than 3 trades to break-even. And except one is reckless, you should NOT lose 7 trades out of 10. Also, if you factor your daily floating drawdown of 5% and your maximum risk on all open positions is 1%, you know for a fact that you can never break the drawdown rule. So, a little math helps alleviate fear of loss. I am not perfect and may get emotional at times but these helped me a lot. Even on trades without SL&gt; I was on the charts monitoring them.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-545083\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Oluwatobi-trades.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"906\" height=\"1235\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Describe your best trade.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>My best trade was not the one with the highest profit but the one that played out according to my pre-market session analysis and trade planning. I was able to accurately predict price action based on institutional market structure, several times back-to-back. It boosts my confidence and experience of the market.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What was more difficult than expected during your FTMO Challenge or Verification?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Hmm! Nothing really. As an index futures trader that came from a prop firm with 3% ($3,000) daily drawdown, this already favoured my trading approach to be able to find FTMO easier. So, my risk management and trading psychology was already configured to ace FTMO. And I think getting a positive RRR was a major challenge for me, and I never really knew how to calculate it. Even though I had a reasonably quite high win rate of 80% to 97% on several accounts.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What is the number one advice you would give to a new trader?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Be confident in your setups. Trust your setups!!! Forget trading biases proliferated online. This is assuming you already have what works well for you. Don&#8217;t use signals. Hone your skills. It&#8217;s worth it in the long run. Focus and have a plan. I have a solid roadmap to a $2m funded account and how to sustain in the long run. Don&#8217;t go searching for any holy grail. Focus on a strategy that works for you.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/trader.ftmo.com\/free-trial?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=banner&amp;utm_campaign=tradersqa\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-543706 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Blog-banner-Free-Trial-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"130\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Blog-banner-Free-Trial-1.jpg 800w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Blog-banner-Free-Trial-1-300x49.jpg 300w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Blog-banner-Free-Trial-1-768x125.jpg 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Blog-banner-Free-Trial-1-705x115.jpg 705w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Blog-banner-Free-Trial-1-24x4.jpg 24w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Blog-banner-Free-Trial-1-36x6.jpg 36w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Blog-banner-Free-Trial-1-48x8.jpg 48w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Trader Nima: &#8220;I always rather have small losses than lose it all.&#8221;<\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-545058\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Nima-190x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"190\" height=\"300\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Describe your best trade.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>My best trades are usually the ones that I have full confidence in the direction of that trade based on my own factors, especially when the trend line is in my favour. I love trading when the volatility is high in the market as the majority of my trades take place during those times.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How did loss limits affect your trading style?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Maximum loss is a great tool that helps me realize how much I am able to trade in a particular setup and not go over that limit.

I always try to set some rules for myself during a losing trade.

Secondly, I do my best not to change my stop loss on trade as this can in some situations make that trade your last trade.<\/p>\n<p><strong>One piece of advice for people starting the FTMO Challenge now.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Never ever give up, success is not a straight line.

There was a small gap down at the open, and I was already anticipating a reversal based on my HTF analysis. Once the price delivered a swing low and broke the structure of that swing to the upside, I got long and earned 2R on that trade. Just beautiful price action.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What was more difficult than expected during your FTMO Challenge or Verification?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I think the hardest part about the FTMO Challenge is the time. Even though I believe traders who have a system with edge should have no problem completing the FTMO Challenge within the time constraints, mentally the time limit can influence bad trading decisions. Enough bad decisions can make the time limit a real issue.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What do you think is the key for long term success in trading?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Having an edge based system that includes no more than 2 or 3 key setups that show up frequently enough for the trader to easily be able to practice patience in those setups appearing. Also, knowing exactly where you&#8217;re going to get in and out of every trade. Risking the same amount on every trade based on the initial funded amount, and consistently allowing your targets (Stop Loss and Take Profit) to hit. Your Take Profit should always be at least twice the size of your Stop Loss. Doing this day in and day out will build consistency.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-545112\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Brandon-trades.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"905\" height=\"1231\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Has your psychology ever affected your trading plan?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Of course!
