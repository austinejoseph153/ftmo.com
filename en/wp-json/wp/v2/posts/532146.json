In terms of risk, I only use around 0.5-1% VAR to ensure that I can still manage it in case drawdowns occur. My strategy has a bad win rate but can generate a good amount of RRR, if executed properly. I\u2019m strict with following my rules because I try my best to execute based on how I backtested my strategy. I used my backtest data as a framework which I can rely on whenever I am executing trades in the live market. Honestly, FTMO helped me to build my trading plan because it made me push myself to analyze data and derive the best possible strategy that will work for a long period of time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Describe your best trade.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>My best trade is during the Challenge phase where I made approx. 15% return in a single trade. It&#8217;s basically a short on AUDJPY. I saw the break of market structure in the Daily timeframe, so I looked for intraday confirmation and executed according to my plan.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What was the hardest obstacle on your trading journey?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first two years of my trading were really difficult. It\u2019s where I almost gave up because it seemed that I was running in circles, it even came to the point where I almost lost the majority of my savings because I was putting money in my trading account just to offset the trading losses that I had. But I had some \u201caha\u201d moments in my third year in trading, where I started learning to trade forex, and discovered how risk management is the key in achieving consistency.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-532187\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Ran-Jared-trades.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"909\" height=\"1220\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Ran-Jared-trades.png 909w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Ran-Jared-trades-224x300.png 224w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Ran-Jared-trades-767x1030.png 767w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Ran-Jared-trades-768x1031.png 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Ran-Jared-trades-525x705.png 525w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Ran-Jared-trades-18x24.png 18w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Ran-Jared-trades-27x36.png 27w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Ran-Jared-trades-36x48.png 36w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 909px) 100vw, 909px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>What was more difficult than expected during your Challenge or Verification?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In terms of my strategy, the difficult part is always when I am running in good profit already then the market decides to go back to my entry price, then eventually hits my stops. It happened multiple times during my FTMO Challenge and Verification. But then again, I am trying my best to follow my plan no matter what happens.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>What do you think is the most important characteristic\/attribute to become a profitable trader?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The most important characteristic a trader must have in order to be profitable is being disciplined. It comes in several forms: following your trading strategy consistently, using a fixed amount of VAR, not being emotional when drawdowns occur, etc. There are too many to mention, but those are the important aspects that you need to consider when trading.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>What is the number one advice you would give to a new trader?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My best and only advice to a new trader is to NEVER GIVE UP! I came to a point where I almost wanted to quit trading because it seemed that I was achieving nothing, but some \u201caha\u201d moments came and here I am. It might take time to learn and be good at this craft, but I swear that this is the best and most rewarding business that you can have in your life!<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Trader Enrique: &#8220;Don\u2019t try to pass an FTMO Challenge with one trade.&#8221;<\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-532157\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Enrique-II-300x225.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Enrique-II-300x225.jpeg 300w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Enrique-II-1030x773.jpeg 1030w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Enrique-II-768x576.jpeg 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Enrique-II-1536x1152.jpeg 1536w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Enrique-II-2048x1536.jpeg 2048w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Enrique-II-1500x1125.jpeg 1500w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Enrique-II-705x529.jpeg 705w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Enrique-II-24x18.jpeg 24w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Enrique-II-36x27.jpeg 36w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Enrique-II-48x36.jpeg 48w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Describe your best trade.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My best trade was USDJPY on 23 April.

Challenge or Verification and how did you overcome it?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During my verification I ran into a psychology battle. I became overconfident and the market humbled me. I started to think that I knew where the market was going at all times just because I was able to read the market. That led to me being in drawdown, so I had to take a step back and tell myself to stick to my plan. Just because we can read the market does not mean we know where the market direction is going.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>How did loss limits affect your trading style?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The maximum loss did not affect my trading style in the slightest. If anything, it was just a friendly reminder that I should not overtrade and instead focus on quality setups instead of quantity and that I should not be trading based on my emotions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>What does your risk management plan look like?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When trading, I risk 1% per trade as I find that works best for me. I am okay with that as it allows me to place 4-5 trades if I wanted to, without worrying about surpassing the daily loss limit. Also, I am fine with losing multiple 1% trades as within my strategy I am able to make it back with just 1 position, if the right setup shows up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-532209\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Amari-trades.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"910\" height=\"1223\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Amari-trades.png 910w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Amari-trades-223x300.png 223w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Amari-trades-766x1030.png 766w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Amari-trades-768x1032.png 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Amari-trades-525x705.png 525w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Amari-trades-18x24.png 18w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Amari-trades-27x36.png 27w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Amari-trades-36x48.png 36w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 910px) 100vw, 910px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><b>What was the hardest obstacle in your trading journey?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The hardest obstacle I ran into was dealing with psychology.
