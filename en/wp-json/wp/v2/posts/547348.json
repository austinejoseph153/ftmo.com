Although the trader &#8220;attacked&#8221; the Maximum Daily Loss limit during the trading period, he managed to get out of the drawdown quite successfully. As far as the maximum loss limit is concerned, he still had enough margin there.<\/p>\n<p>We are of the positive opinion of the RRR (Reward-Risk-Ratio) of 1.58, which would normally indicate that the trader\u2019s strategy should be profitable in the long run. Thus, the success rate of trades below 50% (46.81%) does not bother us either. The trader opened 94 positions in 20 trading days, which is almost 5 positions per day. What is interesting is that the two days when he opened the most positions were his worst losing days. The total size of 440.13 lots means a little over 4.5 lots per position, which is a rather conservative approach for an account size of \u20ac160,000.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-547278\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Objectives-01.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"906\" height=\"1073\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Objectives-01.png 906w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Objectives-01-253x300.png 253w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Objectives-01-870x1030.png 870w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Objectives-01-768x910.png 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Objectives-01-595x705.png 595w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Objectives-01-20x24.png 20w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Objectives-01-30x36.png 30w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Objectives-01-41x48.png 41w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 906px) 100vw, 906px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The Trading Journal shows that in most cases the trader opens positions with Stop Losses and Take Profits set, which is obviously a good approach to limit unnecessarily large losses during unforeseen market movements. The loss per trade only exceeded 2% in one case, usually it is around 0.5 &#8211; 1% , which also shows a consistent approach and well set risk management rules. The trader rarely holds trades overnight and the longest trades last a few hours, so this is a classic case of an intraday trader and the trader does not lose swap fees unnecessarily as a result.<img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-547285\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Journal-01.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"903\" height=\"1020\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Journal-01.png 903w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Journal-01-266x300.png 266w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Journal-01-768x868.png 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Journal-01-624x705.png 624w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Journal-01-21x24.png 21w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Journal-01-32x36.png 32w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Journal-01-42x48.png 42w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 903px) 100vw, 903px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The trader uses a relatively large group of instruments in his trading, but only one asset class is used, which is the currency pairs. Of course, there is nothing wrong with this, quite the opposite. Being able to follow the developments on almost 20 currency pairs can sometimes be difficult and trying to diversify can be rather counterproductive in such cases. For pairs that are long-term losers, the trader might then consider whether they are actually suitable for the chosen strategy. The ratio of buy and sell orders is also rarely balanced, so there is nothing wrong in this respect either.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-547292\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Open-BS-Volume-01.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"906\" height=\"886\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Open-BS-Volume-01.png 906w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Open-BS-Volume-01-300x293.png 300w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Open-BS-Volume-01-768x751.png 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Open-BS-Volume-01-36x36.png 36w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Open-BS-Volume-01-705x689.png 705w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Open-BS-Volume-01-24x24.png 24w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Open-BS-Volume-01-48x48.png 48w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 906px) 100vw, 906px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The second trader also did not avoid a losing period and his curve has a much more volatile course at first glance. However, thanks to his consistent approach (score of 81%), he was able to overcome even relatively large fluctuations and made a high profit. The final result is clearly better than the result of the first trader in terms of percentage and the profit amount.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-547300\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Balance-02.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"914\" height=\"892\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Balance-02.png 914w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Balance-02-300x293.png 300w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Balance-02-768x750.png 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Balance-02-36x36.png 36w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Balance-02-705x688.png 705w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Balance-02-24x24.png 24w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Balance-02-48x48.png 48w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 914px) 100vw, 914px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>This trader also came dangerously close to the Maximum Daily Loss and Maximum Loss limits during the course of trading, which we cannot view positively. While a trader can set his Stop Loss so that he does not exceed the limit, an unexpected significant move after a surprising result of macroeconomic news may mean that even the SL will not protect his account in the end. In any case, a profit of over $28,000 on a $100,000 account is a very good result.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/trader.ftmo.com\/start-challenge?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=banner&amp;utm_campaign=tradersanalysis\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-546397 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_2-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"130\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_2-1.png 800w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_2-1-300x49.png 300w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_2-1-768x125.png 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_2-1-705x115.png 705w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_2-1-24x4.png 24w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_2-1-36x6.png 36w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_2-1-48x8.png 48w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>The trader managed to maintain a positive risk\/reward ratio of 1.2 in 15 trading days. Combined with a trading success rate of 52.14%, his strategy can be successful in the long term. The trader opened 2,092 lots in 140 positions, which represents more than 9 positions per day and nearly 15 lots per position. So he is a fairly active trader, but the position size is fine given the size of the account. Interestingly, the trader had more losing days than profitable ones, and still managed to make very decent profits. It shows a good mental setup where even more losing days does not have to mean a disaster.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-547307\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Objectives-02.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"907\" height=\"1075\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Objectives-02.png 907w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Objectives-02-253x300.png 253w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Objectives-02-869x1030.png 869w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Objectives-02-768x910.png 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Objectives-02-595x705.png 595w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Objectives-02-20x24.png 20w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Objectives-02-30x36.png 30w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Objectives-02-40x48.png 40w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 907px) 100vw, 907px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The trader&#8217;s trading diary shows that he often opens multiple positions or opens additional positions on one instrument. Although it is a Swing account, the trader does not hold trades overnight. We evaluate the Stop Loss and Take Profit settings positively. From our point of view, the biggest problem is the fact that the trader uses the scaling in method, where he opens additional positions at the time when the original position is at a loss.<\/p>\n<p>While this strategy may be profitable for some traders, we cannot recommend it to most traders (you can read more about its advantages and disadvantages in our article). For this trader, these trades have mostly worked out, but sometimes this approach has led to more significant losing periods, which even led to approaching the aforementioned Maximum Loss and Maximum Daily Loss limits.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-547314\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Journal-02.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"909\" height=\"1014\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Journal-02.png 909w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Journal-02-269x300.png 269w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Journal-02-768x857.png 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Journal-02-632x705.png 632w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Journal-02-22x24.png 22w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Journal-02-32x36.png 32w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Journal-02-43x48.png 43w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 909px) 100vw, 909px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The trader traded five instruments in four different asset classes. This is not a very high number, but given their relatively low correlation, we can talk about good diversification. He opened the most trades on the BTCUSD instrument, where he took full advantage of the opportunity to trade over the weekend. This option is tempting for many traders, but it is necessary to take into account that market movements can be significantly affected by low volumes and increased volatility.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/trader.ftmo.com\/start-challenge?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=banner&amp;utm_campaign=tradersanalysis\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-546404 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_1-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"130\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_1-1.png 800w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_1-1-300x49.png 300w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_1-1-768x125.png 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_1-1-705x115.png 705w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_1-1-24x4.png 24w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_1-1-36x6.png 36w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_1-1-48x8.png 48w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Interesting is the relatively large difference in the results of buy and sell positions, although in terms of numbers they are almost the same.
