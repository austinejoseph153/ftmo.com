I have accepted the fact that each trade carries some sort of emotion with it even if it&#8217;s low since money is linked to our survival, but making sure to fix mistakes that won&#8217;t heighten the emotions more than they need to be is key to protect my mind from potential heightened emotions that can lead to costly trades.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What was easier than expected during the FTMO Challenge or Verification?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Thankfully, FTMO&#8217;s support and technicality, tighter spreads, and commissions than my typical brokers and the stats kept me held accountable to stick to what works best as numbers will easily project what works and doesn&#8217;t with a significant trade sample size.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-583712\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/Alexandre-trades.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"907\" height=\"1305\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/Alexandre-trades.png 907w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/Alexandre-trades-209x300.png 209w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/Alexandre-trades-716x1030.png 716w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/Alexandre-trades-768x1105.png 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/Alexandre-trades-490x705.png 490w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 907px) 100vw, 907px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>How would you rate your experience with FTMO?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Very professional, every time I had an issue it was solved very fast.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What do you think is the most important characteristic\/attribute to become a profitable<\/strong> <strong>trader?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Knowing how to spot a system that works or doesn&#8217;t (via rigorous backtesting), knowing what makes a balanced success rate with RRR that won&#8217;t risk blowing the account or dragging it down to huge drawdowns (even if it does have an edge and is profitable long term, we&#8217;re all humans on short term and most can&#8217;t handle the pressures of drawdowns of misbalanced RRR&#8217;s in profitable strategies).

I really like the FTMO Challenge, and I am extremely happy to be part of the FTMO Trader community. FTMO has taught me discipline and adherence to the rules set by the company (aka FTMO). Without these two factors, I wouldn&#8217;t have become a profitable trader.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How did you manage your emotions when you were in a losing trade?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Because I understand the probability of my method, I don&#8217;t panic about the losses I experience. I believe that, in the long run, my method will be profitable for me. The losses I incur are just considered as losing trades or &#8220;losing opportunities,&#8221; as there is no trading strategy that guarantees 100% profit. Additionally, I rarely look at charts, so I am not addicted, and my psychology remains unaffected. The infrequency of checking charts makes me calmer and better able to manage my emotions. No FOMO, no panic, and no addiction.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What was easier than expected during the FTMO Challenge or Verification?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I thought the FTMO Challenge with a 10% Profit Target in 30 days was very difficult to achieve. But unexpectedly, I managed to complete the rules. I didn&#8217;t expect that I could accomplish them. I simply went through the trading process, and suddenly I finished the Challenge. I was surprised! As for the Verification stage, I found it easier than the FTMO Challenge, so I was able to complete it with ease.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-583720\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/Yusuf-trades.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"909\" height=\"1327\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/Yusuf-trades.png 909w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/Yusuf-trades-206x300.png 206w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/Yusuf-trades-706x1030.png 706w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/Yusuf-trades-768x1121.png 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/Yusuf-trades-483x705.png 483w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 909px) 100vw, 909px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Do you have a trading plan in place, and do you follow it strictly?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I only have two methods. One method I use when the market is ranging, and the other method I use when the market is trending. My methods are very rigid. I have already backtested the methods I use. During a ranging market, I only use support and resistance. I place sell limit orders at resistance and buy limit orders at support. When the market is trending, I only use the &#8220;secondary movement&#8221; and place limit orders at Fibonacci extension levels around the 0.5 and 0.618 ratios. Pretty simple, right? I strictly stick to these two methods and do not mix them with other methods like SMC, chart patterns, etc.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How did Maximum Loss limits affect your trading style?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The risk per trade I use is 1%. If my trading capital is $10,000, I&#8217;m willing to lose only $100 on each Stop Loss. When I reach the Take Profit (TP) level, I&#8217;ll also gain around $100 or more. You can see the risk-reward ratio in my account analysis. However, when a major trend has arrived, sometimes I don&#8217;t use Take Profit and let the profit run. This is because I believe that when a market trend arrives, we can achieve significant profits. Even though I don&#8217;t set a Take Profit during a major market trend, I still use a trailing stop (SL+) to limit risks.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What would you like to say to other traders that are attempting an FTMO Challenge?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Understand the probability of the trading method you use, apply it rigorously, strictly, and rigidly, and never underestimate the risks.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/trader.ftmo.com\/start-challenge?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=banner&amp;utm_campaign=tradersqa\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-546397 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_2-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"130\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_2-1.png 800w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_2-1-300x49.png 300w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_2-1-768x125.png 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_2-1-705x115.png 705w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_2-1-24x4.png 24w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_2-1-36x6.png 36w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Banner_2-1-48x8.png 48w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Trader Muhammad: \u201cEmotions like fear, greed, and impatience can greatly influence decision-making.\u201d<\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-583695\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/Muhammad-300x288.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"288\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/Muhammad-300x288.png 300w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/Muhammad-1030x988.png 1030w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/Muhammad-768x737.png 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/Muhammad-36x36.png 36w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/Muhammad-705x676.png 705w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/Muhammad.png 1176w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Describe your best trade.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>One of my most successful trades as a forex trader was when I identified a strong upward trend in the EUR\/USD currency pair. After conducting thorough research and analyzing various economic indicators, central bank policies, and technical chart patterns, I decided to enter a long position at the perfect moment. As the bullish momentum continued to strengthen, I carefully managed my trade, regularly adjusting my Take Profit levels to capitalize on the rising price. To protect my capital from potential market reversals, I also implemented a tight Stop Loss. Throughout the trade, I remained disciplined and avoided the temptation to exit prematurely, allowing the trade to unfold according to my analysis. As the EUR\/USD pair approached a significant resistance level, I made a well-timed exit, securing substantial profits from the trade. The success of this trade emphasized the importance of thorough research, technical analysis, and effective risk management in forex trading. It was an incredibly rewarding experience that boosted my confidence and honed my trading skills in the forex market.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How has passing the FTMO Challenge and Verification changed your life?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>As a forex trader, passing the FTMO Challenge and Verification has been a life-changing experience.

Emotions like fear, greed, and impatience can greatly influence decision-making and lead to impulsive actions that might result in losses.
