Remember not to try to overcome the challenges too quickly because it usually ends badly.<\/p>\n<p>Be careful and you will reap long-term profits and build a regular income.<\/p>\n<h3>Trader Christopher &#8211; The most difficult thing is creating self-discipline with trading<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/chrisp.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-396586\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/chrisp-300x223.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"223\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/chrisp-300x223.jpg 300w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/chrisp-1030x767.jpg 1030w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/chrisp-768x572.jpg 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/chrisp-705x525.jpg 705w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/chrisp.jpg 1312w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Describe your best trade.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It came during the first month of verification.
