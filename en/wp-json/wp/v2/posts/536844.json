I wish it to everyone. I am in a group where we talk about prop firms, and everyone tries to evaluate which is the best. For me FTMO remains a prop firm with the utmost professionalism and seriousness.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What was the most difficult during your FTMO Challenge or Verification and how did you overcome it?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The most difficult obstacle was when after coming close to the end I checked my account and it fell below zero.

I try not to get angry that I have the wrong evaluation, I try to find the solution to win, I try to see the glass half full because when I am in these situations, and I manage to get out of the loss my gain is usually much greater.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How did loss limits affect your trading style?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Honestly, they improved it, with my capital I had no limits, but in reality, that was the limit.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What would you like to say to other traders who are attempting the FTMO Challenge?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Trading is an exceptional job and as such it must be taken. In all jobs you need discipline, seriousness, ambition, and know-how. You must not be in a hurry to get rich because in trading it is seen only this way or to become rich immediately. It is just work, unlike others it will make you feel good financially if done seriously. A lot of study and no improvisation are needed.<\/p>\n<h3>Trader Kyle: &#8220;Life is about opportunity, and opportunity is about preparation.&#8221;<\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-536883\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Kyle-203x300.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"203\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Kyle-203x300.png 203w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Kyle-478x705.png 478w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Kyle-16x24.png 16w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Kyle-24x36.png 24w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Kyle-33x48.png 33w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Kyle.png 666w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 203px) 100vw, 203px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>What do you think is the most important characteristic\/attribute to become a profitable trader?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Determination. To be honest, I lost my funded account once before getting this one. I&#8217;m not sharing this because I want people to give me credit, but I want to show that it&#8217;s all a mind game. Trading is war, and the first part of war is showing up. If you show up, you can at least try. However, if you stop showing up you can&#8217;t even give yourself a chance. So always show up!<\/p>\n<p><strong>Do you plan to take another FTMO Challenge to manage an even bigger capital?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I always work to set the bar higher than before because for me it&#8217;s all about growth. I want to see myself go beyond what I thought was even possible. When I first started trading, becoming funded was a dream beyond a dream. Now that I am funded, I&#8217;m already looking for that next milestone. It&#8217;s not that I need to prove to other people of my self-worth through acquiring a bigger capital, it&#8217;s more so that I&#8217;m afraid of comfort.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How did passing the FTMO Challenge and Verification change your life?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Life is about opportunity, and opportunity is about preparation. FTMO is simply an opportunity for traders out there to reach their next goals in life.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-536953\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Kyle-trades.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"914\" height=\"1242\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Kyle-trades.png 914w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Kyle-trades-221x300.png 221w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Kyle-trades-758x1030.png 758w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Kyle-trades-768x1044.png 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Kyle-trades-519x705.png 519w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Kyle-trades-18x24.png 18w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Kyle-trades-26x36.png 26w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Kyle-trades-35x48.png 35w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 914px) 100vw, 914px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>What do you think is the key for long-term success in trading?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Find a support system that works for you. This doesn&#8217;t have to mean people. This is the thing that is going to be your &#8220;reason&#8221;. For me it&#8217;s my childhood memories. I didn&#8217;t have much growing up as I was raised by a single mother. I did, however, witness kids around me who had it all. I always envied them, but by not having the opportunities that they had it made me resourceful. It made me hungry. So when I think in terms of long-term success, it&#8217;s about having that concrete system in place that is going to propel you through any trial and tribulation. The thing that makes success not an option, but a necessity.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What was the hardest obstacle on your trading journey?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The hardest obstacle in my trading journey has been the constant fear of letting down those who believe in me. I care so much about doing well for them that sometimes I forget how far I&#8217;ve come. I&#8217;ve never been the type to congratulate myself for my accomplishments and so I have a hard time genuinely feeling that way. I have what I call a never satisfied disease, so having to remind myself that it&#8217;s okay to celebrate those small wins has been my greatest challenge.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What would you like to say to other traders who are attempting the FTMO Challenge?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been trading for 3 years now, and I&#8217;ve met many talented people along my journey. So, to those who dream of becoming real traders I say this. Everyone you meet is a teacher in some way. It&#8217;s your job to immerse yourself in the process of learning from those that you meet along your own journey. It&#8217;s about learning how to be the best that you can be. There is no &#8220;work life balance&#8221;. It\u2019s just do or don&#8217;t. If you want to be great at what you do, that&#8217;s just what it takes.
