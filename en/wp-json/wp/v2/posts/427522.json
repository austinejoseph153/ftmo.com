My plan is structured and concise and goes as follows: I never risk more than 1% on a singular trade (no matter how enticing the particular setup may be) and I don&#8217;t open more than 2 trades in a single 24-hour period. I have begun to find myself more comfortable risking an average of 0.5% in order to emphasize the longevity of the account as much as possible. I follow this plan strictly.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How has passing FTMO Challenge and Verification changed your life?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Passing the FTMO Challenge &amp; Verification has given me the morale boost and confidence many people seek as traders. Passing has validated my skills and given me a reaffirmation that I am on the right track.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What was more difficult than expected during your FTMO Challenge or Verification?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Personally, the FTMO Challenge was more difficult simply because the profit target is greater and the time constraint is also greater.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-427531\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Alejandro-trades.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"907\" height=\"1284\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Alejandro-trades.png 907w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Alejandro-trades-212x300.png 212w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Alejandro-trades-728x1030.png 728w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Alejandro-trades-768x1087.png 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Alejandro-trades-498x705.png 498w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Alejandro-trades-17x24.png 17w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Alejandro-trades-25x36.png 25w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Alejandro-trades-34x48.png 34w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 907px) 100vw, 907px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>What inspires you to pursue trading?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Freedom. The ability to work on your own schedule whilst having infinite profit potential is invaluable.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How did you eliminate the factor of luck in your trading?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t believe there is such a thing as the elimination of luck from trading. As a trader all you can do is apply your skill set and work hard to find good setups in the market. Sometimes your technical analysis may prove to be incorrect, but luck happens to be on your side, or vice versa. However, relying on luck is not a trading strategy.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What would you like to say to other traders that are attempting their FTMO Challenge?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I would say to traders looking to attempt the Challenge that you should prepare for at minimum 3-4 months of backtesting before trying. This way you will have the utmost confidence when it matters most. And even if the worst comes to worst and you don&#8217;t pass, keep going. Keep going, keep going, keep going. One day it&#8217;s bound to happen.<\/p>\n<h3>Trader Trina: \u201cI look at trading as an art.\u201d<\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-427537\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Trina-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Trina-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Trina-1030x773.jpg 1030w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Trina-768x576.jpg 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Trina-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Trina-1500x1125.jpg 1500w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Trina-705x529.jpg 705w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Trina-24x18.jpg 24w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Trina-36x27.jpg 36w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Trina-48x36.jpg 48w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Trina.jpg 1544w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>What inspires you to pursue trading?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>When I got into trading I wanted to find something that would allow me to make extra income and have more free time. However, from the last year I have fallen in love with trading for a number of reasons. Now I do it because it makes me happy. I look at trading as an art. From drawing on the charts to bringing it to life. You are creating something, an expression. Growing up we are taught the only way to live is to go to school, get a job, and retire. However, learning to trade opens up your eyes to the fact that there is a number of ways that we should be living and that isn&#8217;t the only way. So to put simply trading brings hope for me. I have also grown to love the growth of my mindset. Trading has pushed me to think in a different way, not only about trading but in my daily life. I have had to learn that in all you do your &#8220;mindset matters&#8221;. Your mindset is the thing that dictates your successes or failures. And for this I am forever thankful.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Describe your best trade.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>For me my best trade was not in dollar amount. My best trade was the trade that showed me my strategy worked and the reason I kept losing was from psychology errors. I had begun to start watching the consistency of my profits. I started to see the endless possibilities, which was the best trade I had. On this day, I woke up around 12 at night with my trade deep in profit, on its way to my take profit.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What do you think is the key to long-term success in trading?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Psychology. Simply psychology because the greater you get with your mindset, the better your trading results will be.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-427549\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Trina-trades-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"913\" height=\"1277\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Trina-trades-1.png 913w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Trina-trades-1-214x300.png 214w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Trina-trades-1-736x1030.png 736w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Trina-trades-1-768x1074.png 768w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Trina-trades-1-504x705.png 504w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Trina-trades-1-17x24.png 17w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Trina-trades-1-26x36.png 26w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Trina-trades-1-34x48.png 34w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 913px) 100vw, 913px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>How did you eliminate the factor of luck in your trading?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Consistency. I kept trading through losses and wins and that\u2019s how I realized this isn&#8217;t luck.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How did you manage your emotions when you were in a losing trade?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Psychology. Reminding myself that none of the information being offered to me is harmful. Reminding myself to relax. Choosing to go do something else with my time. I also calculate my loss in dollar amount and if I am emotionally, mentally okay with it then I have a good lot size.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What is the number one piece of advice you would give to a new trader?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Do not focus on just the trading and finding a strategy. Take some time and focus more on the psychology, &#8220;the growth of your mindset&#8221; especially when it comes to dealing with losses. There is no way to trade without a loss and the sooner you accept it the better you will be. Losing is a cost of doing business.<\/p>\n<h3>Trader Mason: \u201cOnly take the challenge if you know you\u2019re ready and are trading profitably consistently.\u201d<\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-427555\" src=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Mason-174x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"174\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Mason-174x300.jpg 174w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Mason-598x1030.jpg 598w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Mason-409x705.jpg 409w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Mason-14x24.jpg 14w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Mason-21x36.jpg 21w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Mason-28x48.jpg 28w, https:\/\/ftmo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Mason.jpg 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 174px) 100vw, 174px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>What do you think is the most important characteristic\/attribute of a profitable trader?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Discipline, patience &amp; risk management.
